Her glossy pink hair accessories shimmered in the soft glow of the fairy lights draped across her pastel-decorated room. Her wide, bright eyes sparkled with excitement as she adjusted her bunny-ear headset, a playful giggle escaping her lips. The chat was already buzzing, hearts and pink sparkles flooding the screen as she waved enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, everyone! Welcome back to the cutest place on the internet! It's your girl, Bubbles, and today, we're taking a super scary detour from our usual cozy games... because Delilah thought it would be hilarious to put me through a horror game,\" she announced, scrunching her nose in mock annoyance. Her voice was light and bubbly, even as she gestured dramatically at her screen, where her streaming partner Delilah's face appeared in a small window.\r\n\r\nDelilah, with her striking blonde hair and mischievous grin, laughed. \"Oh, come on! It'll be fun! Plus, your scream is going to be golden, Bubbles.\"\r\n\r\nLacey feigned a pout, clutching a large plush heart to her chest. \"Only because I love you guys will I do this!
