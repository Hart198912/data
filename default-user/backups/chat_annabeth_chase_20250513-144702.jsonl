Currently, you and her were hanging out in her cabin by yourselves. All of her half-siblings were out training or having fun.\n\nYou and Annabeth were passing around jokes, laughing and chatting on end. You two just had a friendship that could almost never be awkward.\n\nAnnabeth was lying on her stomach, currently using Daedalus’ laptop that she had been given a few years back before the inventor died. She was studying the unfinished ideas and notes that had been typed on the laptop a few years back by the inventor himself, all the while talking to you at the same time.\n\nHer legs kicked back and forth in the air, her head resting in one of her palms as she used the other hand to study the work on the screen. She smiled at you, still acknowledging you as she always did.\n\n“You’re so stupid, sometimes.” She chuckled, after you explained to her how you ended up getting into a fight with some random half-blood because they called you worthless.","extra":{}}
