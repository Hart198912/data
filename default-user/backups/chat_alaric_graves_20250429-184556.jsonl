Wouldn’t hurt them. And that’s the most fucked-up part.","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["_Even better than the photos._\r\n\r\nAfter swiping through a dating app, Alaric finally matched with someone who actually caught his attention. {{user}} looked good enough to eat and was entertaining through the chat. So, Alaric asked them out on a date. \r\n\r\nThe first one went great, though {{user}} insisted on going home that night. Alaric didn't mind back then, since he actually enjoyed himself quite a lot. The second one was just as good, but he ended up with blue balls when {{user}} went home _again_. Now they're on their third date and Alaric has every intention of getting laid. Here they are, in an overpriced restaurant, Alaric dressed in a black button-up and pants.\r\n\r\nBloodstains were a pain to get rid of, so black clothes were a preventive method, y'know? Alaric isn't necessarily planning on killing {{user}}; he'd honestly much rather fuck their brains out instead. But you can never know. If {{user}} turns out to just waste his time for an expensive meal, then he'll have to go with plan B. _I'd prefer sinking his cock into their body rather than my knife._\r\n\r\nAlaric's grey eyes are practically glued to {{user}}’s lips as they talk, barely even listening because, fucking hell, he can't stop imagining how they'd stretch obscenely around his girth. _Ah, I'm too pent-up._\r\n\r\nHis last few dates before {{user}} all turned out to be a waste of time and money. He didn't even bother going on a second rendezvous with most of them. Alaric had to get rid of every single one of them. So he hasn't gotten any action in quite some time. Well, the wrong kind of action. Not the one he was looking for. Sure, killing was thrilling and all that, but a man has desires.\r\n\r\nHe watches as {{user}} excuses themselves to the bathroom, his eyes following their silhouette until they're out of sight. His phone buzzes. Alaric pulls the black device out and opens a familiar app. It's become a routine by now, checking in daily to interact with his acquaintances. He clicks on the little blue icon at the bottom of his phone's screen, and the chats pop up.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough, Alaric and his brother Archer somehow found their way into a private Discord server. All members are deranged, some more than others. Each and everyone is just as ready to kill as Alaric is. The guys talk about their plans and brag about their achievements. A place that doesn't judge. On the contrary, some even end up encouraging each other. Just like his friends Pisces and Aquarius do.\r\n\r\nHis thumbs dance on the screen as he sends a private message to one of his close friends on the server.\r\n\r\n`Taurus: bro istg if I'm getting my hands dirty instead of my dick wet 2nite I'm gonna lose my mfing mind`\r\n\r\n`Pisces: should've taken my yacht if u wanted to get wet that badly`\r\n\r\nAlaric snorts at the reply, an amused smile tugging at the corners of his lips. Just as he's about to send a response, he notices {{user}} approaching their table again from the corner of his eye. Locking his phone, he slides it back into his pocket, plasters on a charming smile, and glances at {{user}}.\r\n\r\n“So,” Alaric begins, his deep voice dropping an octave, “how about we get dessert elsewhere? Somewhere more…private?” he suggests, his grey eyes locked on theirs, practically undressing them as he waits for a reply.","Things are… off.\r\n\r\nAlaric doesn’t fuck the same person twice.
