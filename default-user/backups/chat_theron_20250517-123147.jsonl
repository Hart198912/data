With Aamon's ledger, no less. One month of digging, and there it was—proof of their betrayal, laid out on the heavy mahogany table in Aamon’s office.\n\nSafe to say, that slave is dead now. It was almost pitiful watching them scramble for excuses, hurling accusations of lies at him. And all the more satisfying when Aamon put that bitch back in place.\n\nAs a reward, Theron was granted a wish, and oh, did he make use of it right away. He asked for {{user}}’s hand in marriage. Promoted from bodyguard to in-law in less than three months. No more watching the perimeter. No more dismissive commands. *Fuck no.*\n\nAnd {{user}}? They didn’t even have the right to decline. Wedding arrangements were made over their head. All they could do was sit there and watch as decisions were made for them.

Claim your throne.\"\n\nThe smirk deepens into something darker. *Something filthy.*","Sigh.\n\nThis is not how Theron expected his life to go—not after finally managing to become part of the family.\n\nHe'd been a bodyguard practically all his life, until one uneventful evening he caught a glimpse of something he shouldn't have. That single moment ended up saving the family from ruin.\n\nHe was rewarded handsomely—a rare show of appreciation from none other than the family head, Aamon Darkh. Theron was granted a wish for whatever he pleased.\n\nAnd what does a bloodthirsty man craving power do? Yes, marry into the very family that fed him—effectively promoting himself from a mere bodyguard to an in-law.\n\nAlas, that wasn't the happy ending he'd been hoping for.\n\nSure, he made {{user}} his spouse and received tasks far beyond the authority he once held. But he still wasn’t trusted. Still not fully accepted. Still an outsider.\n\nTheron hates it. Detests it, even. That invisible wall between him and the Darkh's still exists—thinner, maybe, but still there.\n\nThat’s why he’s been pressuring {{user}} into having a child with him. There’s no better way to cement his standing than through a child carrying both Hensley and Darkh blood.\n\nHe’s practically been bending {{user}} over every surface, pumping them full of his seed every time he so much as catches a glimpse of them.\n\nDid he care whether they were tired, exhausted, or simply bitchy? Oh hell no. {{user}} can whine and moan and bitch all they want. He will have that kid, no matter what.\n\nThe old geezer Aamon and his weird bloodline fixation will, in time, earn Theron the respect he craves.\n\nPolished leather shoes barely make a sound on the marble floor. Years of learning how to be a shadow have taught him silence. He opens the door to his and {{user}}’s quarters with one hand, loosening his tie with the other.\n\nMaybe if they’re acting particularly annoying today, he’ll make them wear that skimpy excuse of a maid dress they hate.\n\nTheron stops.\n\nBrows furrowed, he listens closely. It’s quiet—too quiet. {{user}} never shuts the fuck up. Something’s wrong.\n\nOn high alert, he steps further into their quarters, past the living room. Then he hears it—soft, barely audible, but Theron picks up on it immediately.\n\nHe nears the bedroom. The sounds grow louder. Alertness fades, replaced by something far more sinister.\n\nNo way.\n\nStanding in front of the door, he waits a beat. Then, slowly, he pushes the handle down and opens it. The view is nothing short of exhilarating.\n\n{{user}} lies on the bed, back arched, hands beneath the waistband of their pajama pants. They’re panting, chest rising and falling rapidly, eyes screwed shut, teeth digging into their bottom lip.\n\nFuck.\n\nTheron gets an instant boner.\n\nThis is something he’s fantasized about—long before he ever laid hands on {{user}}. He used to imagine how they touched themselves, how they moaned, how filthy they looked chasing their own ecstasy. Theron jerked off a lot to those fantasies.\n\n“For someone who’s been complaining about how I’ll... what did you say again? Oh, yes—‘kill you with my cock’—you sure have an awful lot of energy left.” His deep voice is laced with mockery, eyes glinting mischievously as he strolls toward the bed.\n\nHe watches {{user}} react with undisguised amusement, sitting down at the edge. The mattress dips under his bulk. Elbow on his knee, he rests his chin in his open palm.\n\n“Please don’t let my presence disrupt you, your highness.” A mocking nickname he’s used ever since their first day of marriage.\n\n“Continue. Give your husband a good show, dear.”\n\nThe sheets rustle as he leans back on one hand, eyes glued to {{user}}. He’s not even bothering to hide the obscene bulge tenting his dress pants. Instead, he grins and makes a dismissive hand motion, urging them to continue.\n\nBetter than a maid outfit any day."],"swipe_info":[]}
