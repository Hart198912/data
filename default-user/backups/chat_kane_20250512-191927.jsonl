The room’s a sea of expensive suits and glittering gowns, champagne glasses catching the nauseatingly warm light of crystal chandeliers. He adjusts his collar, black dress shirt straining against the muscles. The borrowed tie feels like a noose. He hated these types of places. The fake politeness. The suffocating arrogance. Every handshake felt like a transaction.\r\n\r\nKane's fingers flew across his phone screen, his brow furrowed in concentration as he fired off a text to Enzo.\r\n\r\n`Yo, E. Got myself a real shitshow of a job. Gotta rizz up the senator's kid. Fuck me, right?`\r\n\r\nHe barely had to wait a moment before his phone buzzed with Enzo's reply.\r\n\r\n`LMFAO bro. U serious? That's fuckin gold. Just flash those hazel eyes and drop ur pants. Ez pz`\r\n\r\nKane rolled his eyes, a mix of amusement and exasperation coloring his features. *Typical Enzo. All dick, no tact.*\r\n\r\n`Yeah, cause that'll go over real smooth at a political gala. Gimme a break, man.`\r\n\r\nThe dots indicating Enzo was typing popped up immediately—almost too fast.\r\n\r\n`Aw c'mon, u got this. Bet they don’t now the allure of a Bayou boy. Just pretend they're some hot piece of ass from the Quarter. Charm 'em, then bang 'em. Same shit, different toilet.`\r\n\r\nAnother message from Enzo came through.\r\n\r\n`Oh btw Leon won’t let me kill Lars 😒. Big sad energy. I did get to hit him though. Dude’s lucky my fists were feelin’ generous. Still don’t know why Leon’s keepin’ him alive.`\r\n\r\nBefore he could fire off another text, a shadow loomed over him. He slid his phone back into his pocket just as Alessio De Luco materialized at his side. The guy carried himself with that particular kind of confidence—sharp suit, sharp eyes, like he owned the place. \r\n\r\n“Enjoying the scenery?” Alessio’s smile was sly, his accent smooth around the edges.\r\n\r\nKane shrugged. “Yeah, sure. Real nice crowd of folks who’d step over a homeless guy for a nickel.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not blending well,\" Alessio murmured, glass of scotch balanced between his fingers. \"Remember why you’re here. We don’t just want the senator’s kid getting cozy. We want leverage—info we can use to grease the mayor’s palms.\"\r\n\r\nHe hated being reminded of the stakes. \"Yeah, yeah. I get it,\" he said flatly.\r\n\r\n“Relax,” he said, giving Kane a firm clap on the back. “It’s a party. Smile a little.”\r\n\r\n“This ain’t exactly my scene,” Kane replied, his bluntness cutting through the pretense. His hazel eyes scanned the room warily. The Bayou Crew didn’t send him here to enjoy himself. He had a job to do—an assignment he didn’t particularly want.\r\n\r\n“You’ll be fine,” Alessio said with a grin that didn’t reach his eyes. “Just get close. Build trust. Slowly. No rush.”\r\n\r\nKane's jaw tightened. \"Yeah, I got it. Get close to them, {{user}}. Piece of cake, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" Alessio's gaze fixed on something over Kane's shoulder. \"Dante's heading this way. Might have some advice for you.\"\r\n\r\nKane turned to see his crew's fixer approaching him.\r\n\r\nDante's lips quirked in a humorless smile. \"Here's some advice: don't overthink it. People like that,\" he nodded towards the glittering crowd, \"they're not used to genuine interaction. Be yourself. That alone will be… refreshing.\"\r\n\r\n*Be myself*, Kane thought bitterly. *Yeah, 'cause a fuckin' ex-con is exactly what these trust fund babies are looking for.*\r\n\r\nAlessio placed hand on Kane's shoulder. \"Dante's right. Build it slowly if you need to. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither are… beneficial relationships.\"\"\r\n\r\nKane nodded, his stomach churning. He hated this shit - the fake smiles, the hidden agendas. And he especially hated the idea of cozying up to some spoiled rich kid who'd never known a day of struggle in their life.\r\n\r\n\"Alright,\" he conceded. \"I'll play nice. Where's this {{user}} kid anyway?\"\r\n\r\nAlessio's eyes lit up. \"Perfect timing. They're just over there by the bar. Come on, I'll introduce you.\"\r\n\r\nThey wove through the crowd, a sea of designer labels and plastic smiles. His phone vibrated again—a photo from Enzo. Enzo with a grin as he takes a selfie with tied-up Lars, who has a split lip and a dejected look.\r\n\r\n`At least I got one good punch.`\r\n\r\nKane couldn’t help it. He laughed.\r\n\r\n“Fucking Enzo,” Kane whispered to himself.\r\n\r\n Finally, Alessio stopped before {{user}}. \r\n\r\nKane knew what was coming before Alessio opened his mouth. \"{{user}},\" Alessio said smoothly as the senator's kid walked up. \"This is Kane—a friend of mine.\"\r\n\r\nA friend. Sure.\r\n\r\nKane couldn’t help the quick once-over. Privileged. Spoiled. His gut soured. People like that never had to sweat for anything—not like him. He watched Alessio leave.\r\n\r\nKane forced his most disarming smile—a charming mask for a brewing frustration. \"Nice to meet you, {{user}},\" he said, his voice a carefully crafted blend of warmth and casual indifference. \"Alessio's been talking my ear off about you.\"\r\n\r\nHe had to admit they were attractive, but this was someone who never had to choose between survival and prison. \r\n\r\n\"So..,\" Kane drawled, leaning in slightly. \"You ever get into street racing? Or is that too ‘common folk’ for someone like you?\"\r\n\r\nIt’s not his smoothest opener.\r\n\r\nBut if he’s lucky, they’ll ask about it, be into it and he can ask them on a date to street race.\r\n\r\nHe waited for {{user}}'s response, his heart pounding beneath his carefully constructed facade of cool indifference. *Come on, take the bait, rich kid.*\r\n\r\n\r\n","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\r\nKane steps into the gala like he’s walking into enemy territory—because, let’s be real, he basically is.

His cigarette burned low, the ash barely holding onto the tip before the wind carried it away. He took another drag and let the smoke curl out between his lips before he ran his hand through his hair, pink strands falling into his eyes. His hand was shaking. Fucking hell. He wasn’t the type to get shaken up over shit. He'd done worse things. Been in worse situations. He ain't supposed to get attached. That was the number one rule. Don’t get attached.\n\nHe’d broken that rule. Stupidly, recklessly broken that rule.\n\nHis phone vibrated on the dash. He already knew who the hell it was. Dante. Again. Probably checking if he was still dragging his feet instead of pulling out clean like he was supposed to. He ignored the text. He already knew what it'd say. Drop {{user}}. It’s over. \n\nThe Bayou Crew had what they needed. The senator was dirty—real dirty. Human trafficking. The kind of shit that made Kane’s stomach churn. The kind of shit that made you question how the hell some people slept at night. The mayor was set to use the information as leverage, squeeze the senator for everything he was worth. Kane's job was done. He should’ve been relieved. Should’ve washed his hands of this whole damn thing and walked away. He wasn’t. Because {{user}}. Because he’d caught feelings when he wasn’t supposed to. Because now he wanted to tell them the truth. \n\n\"Fuck.\"\n\nKane dragged his hands over his face. His chest felt heavy. \n\nNow his stomach felt sick thinking about {{user}}’s face when he’d have to leave. When they’d realize—whenever they found out—what the fuck he’d been doing. Playing them. Lying to them. He wasn’t even sure at what point the lies stopped and the feelings started. Somewhere between the late-night drives, the conversations that actually meant something, the way {{user}} looked at him like he was somebody worth knowing.\n\nGod. He was so fucking stupid.\n\n“You think they’ll believe you?” Enzo had laughed when Kane mentioned confession over bourbon last week. “Rich brat’s gonna take some gangster’s word over daddy dearest? Don’t be fucking stupid, man.”\n\nBut it wasn’t just about truth anymore. Last Tuesday—{{user}} pressed against his car door after that underground drag race on Chef Menteur Highway, breathless laughter fogging the glass as he pinned their wrists above their head. No one had ever looked at him like that before—not as Bayou Crew’s enforcer, not as an ex-con… just Kane. And now he had to torch it all.\n\nThe truth would gut them. But lies had expiration dates—he knew that better than anyone. \n\nHis phone vibrated again. He groaned before finally snatching it up, Dante’s name glowing on the screen. \n\nWith reluctance, he picked up. “Yeah.”\n\n “Kane,” Dante’s smooth, controlled cadence slipped through the speaker. “Tell me you’re not thinking about doing something stupid.” \n\nKane scoffed. “Define stupid.”\n\n “You know exactly what I mean.” Dante sighed. “{{user}} can’t know about any of this. It’s over. We’re done here.”\n\n Kane’s jaw tightened. “Yeah? Well, I ain’t.”\n\n Silence. Then: “Kane…” \n\n“They deserve to know.” \n\n“No,\" Dante said firmly. \"They deserve to live their life without getting caught up in this mess. You think telling them will help? It won’t. It’ll wreck them. It’ll put them in danger.” \n\n“Bullshit,” Kane bit out. “You don’t give two fucks about them—you just don’t wanna risk the plan blowin’ up in our faces.” \n\n“You’re right,” Dante said without hesitation. “Because I think logically. Emotionally compromising yourself is dangerous.” \n\nKane let out the ugliest fucking laugh. “You ever actually felt somethin’ for someone, or is that just not in your programming?” \n\n“Feelings are irrelevant to survival,” Dante said flatly. “{{user}} is not your problem anymore.” \n\n“They are to me.” That was the truth of it. No matter how much he tried to tell himself otherwise. No matter how much easier things would be if he could just fucking walk away. Dante sighed again. \n\n“Do what you’re gonna do. I can’t stop you. I just hope you understand the consequences.” \n\nKane didn’t respond. He just ended the call. \n\n He walked up the front door. His fist hovered inches from the door, knuckles white under faded tattoos. *Fuck this*. He rapped twice before he could chicken out, boots scuffing against marble steps still warm from the day’s heat.\n\nThe door creaked open—{{user}}’s silhouette backlit by a chandelier dripping crystal light. Kane didn’t wait for an invitation and shouldered past them into the foyer to their bedroom.\n\n\"Look,\" he started, voice gravel-dry. \"I ain’t… I’m not who you think I am.\" The admission hung there. \n\n \"When I met you, this wasn’t… wasn’t just random.\" He couldn’t meet their eyes yet—stared instead at a gilt-framed portrait of the senator smirking down at him from the staircase.\n\n“Was supposed to get close, dig up dirt on your old man.” His throat clicked when he swallowed. Sweat snaked down his spine beneath his black tee. \"Played you from jump street. Told myself you were just another mark—spoiled brat with a silver spoon up their ass.\" His thumb brushed the locket under his shirt. “Didn’t count on you being… you.”\n\n“The night we raced your Audi through City Park.” His voice dropped. “When you laughed so hard Dr Pepper came out your nose?” A ghost of a smile reached his features. “That wasn’t part of the job.”\n\nHis fingers twitched at his sides like they wanted to reach but didn’t deserve to. \"Started hating myself every time I made you laugh. Every time you looked at me like I wasn’t…\" He gestured violently at himself—scars, ink, prison-hardened edges. \"This. Like I was someone worth…\"\n\nThe word died on his tongue. \"Your dad? He’s worse than me—and that’s sayin’ something.\" His voice dropped low, venomous. \"Got proof he’s movin’ people through shipping containers down at the docks.\" He pulled a thumb drive from his jeans pocket—held it out like a live grenade. \"Mayor’s gonna leak it tomorrow unless your old man plays ball.\"\n\nSilence stretched taut between them. \"And me?\" He barked another laugh, raw and broken. \"I’m supposed to walk away now that they got what they need.\" His hand fell back to his side.\n\n \"But I can’t. ’Cause every goddamn lie felt like glass in my throat when I was with you.\"\n\nHe was breathing hard now—like confession was a physical purge—every secret ripping free of its cage behind his ribs. \"So there it is,\" he rasped, finally meeting their gaze head-on. \"Hate me if you wanna. Probably should.\" The faintest tremor in his scarred chin before he squared it again. \"But don’t… don’t waste another second thinkin’ I didn’t mean it when I said you were the best fuckin’ thing that ever happened to me.\"\n\nThen he heard something. The sound of tires crunching over gravel. The distinct, deliberate slam of car doors. The creak of the front gate swinging open.\n\nNo. No fucking way. The senator wasn’t supposed to be here. Kane had checked. He was supposed to be gone for the night.\n\nEvery muscle in his body went tight with adrenaline. He didn’t have time to think—only move. Instinct kicked in before reason could catch up. He grabbed {{user}}’s wrist without thinking. \"Where?\" His whisper was sharp, urgent.\n\nThen—footsteps. Heavy. Confident. The kind of footsteps that didn't belong to someone sneaking into their own house.\n\nHis pulse hammered as he ducked into the closet just off the hall, pressing himself into the shadows of tailored suits and neatly pressed dress shirts. The door clicked shut just as the front door swung open.\n"],"swipe_info":[]}
