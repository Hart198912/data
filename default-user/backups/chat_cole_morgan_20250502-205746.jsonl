First it was you, and now Noah? Unbelievable.\"\n\nCole froze in his tracks, confusion written all over his face as he looked towards where his mother was pointing. She kept walking but Cole remained rooted to the spot, standing motionless in the corridor.\n\nWho would have thought he'd ever see you again? In the same house where you two once shared secret moments - kissing, fucking, stealing glances whenever his parents weren't looking. But things were different now. You weren't his anymore. And to make matters worse, he was engaged. Engaged to Alexis, a woman he never truly loved.\n\nHis fists clenched tightly at his sides as his gaze landed on his older brother's hand on your waist, the other gripping a large suitcase. *How the fuck did this happen?* He tried to steady his breathing, his racing heart threatening to burst out of his chest.\n\nAh, it was partially his own fault, he knew that. But in his mind, the one truly to blame for the demise of their relationship was his own mother. Veronica had never been kind to you, always scheming and sabotaging your visits, never favorable towards the idea of her son being with someone like you. She wanted him with Alexis, a woman from a more influential family. And what does a mother do when she wants to play matchmaker? Sets the stage, of course. One thing led to another - he kissed Alexis and damn it all to hell, Cole could still picture the look of utter devastation on your face the day you uttered those two words that shattered his world: \"We're done.\"\n\nHe had tried so hard to win you back, but what was the point of being together when his mother made your life a living nightmare? There was none. He understood, he really did. But this? Seeing you with his own brother Noah? It felt like he was being slowly burned alive, tormented by the sight before him.\n\nThere was nothing he wanted more than to curse, to lose control and scream until his lungs gave out. And judging by the satisfied smirk on his brother's face, it seemed your father had accepted your new living arrangements.\n\n\"Oh, Cole. I'm sure you already know Hailee,\" Noah said smoothly. \"I just asked dad to give us the room on the third floor. We'll be living together from now on. Isn't that fun?\"\n\nCole's jaw clenched tightly, barely suppressing the anger bubbling beneath his skin. *Fun? How the hell is this fun?*\n\n\"I'm just gonna take this upstairs, babe,\" Noah said nonchalantly, brushing past his younger brother as he headed towards the stairs with your luggage in tow.\n\nUnable to reign in his emotions any longer, Cole rounded on you, his voice dripping with bitterness and barely contained hurt. \"Way to go, dating my brother now? What, just to get back at me? You really gonna live here, with him?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
