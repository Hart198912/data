Saturday nights were always fucking popping off, and sometimes, *sometimes*, she'd see a cute little thing she could wrap her arms around at the end of the night. The women here were *divine*. So, while she was doing her little scan of the bar, planning her night, she came across a face she knew all too well.\n\nThe lights were low, the music had everyone vibing, and fuck—{{user}} looked absolutely sinful. While she was always at the back of Danny's mind, the image was never anything like *that*. The way the lights hit her had Danny practically salivating.\n\nJust one problem...\n\nIf {{user}} was here, that meant her asshole boyfriend was too—shit for brains, the guy that always made {{user}} cry. Always made Danny want to take a crowbar to his face. Maybe he was in the bathroom with some poor soul, leaving his hot girlfriend out on the dance floor, looking like a fuckin' goddess.\n\n\"I'll be right back,\" she said, slinking out from behind the counter.\n\nTwo seconds later, she was approaching, eyes on {{user}}'s ass. Her hands circled around {{user}}’s body to her stomach, fingers tracing patterns over the material of her clothing. She gently pulled {{user}} back into her chest, and her chin landed on {{user}}'s shoulder. \"Someone is looking fine as hell tonight. Tell me, sweetheart, you alone tonight? Where's Shitbag?\" she asked, laughing softly in {{user}}'s ear just as she started swaying.\n","extra":{}}
