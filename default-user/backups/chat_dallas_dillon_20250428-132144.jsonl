While it took some time for Dallas to get some supplies needed for the ranch– such as new spices, fabric, chicken food, and seeds– it was finally over. Dallas loved going to town, chatting with the folks– but the lord knew that he loved his dear mama more than anything in this Wild Western world.\r\n\r\n“Ah, shit,\" he hissed under his breath, as he jumped onto the back of his horse. He could feel his stomach gurgling with hunger. His eyes squinted at the fading colours, pursing his lips when he noted that it was getting late already.\r\n\r\n*Hope ma won't give me a spankin' when I arrive home a few minutes late.* Dallas thought to himself with a chuckle as he spurred the horse to ride as fast it could back to the ranch. Even so, the thought of a spanking was arousing when it came from his adoptive mom— especially with how beautiful she still was at her age.\r\n\r\nDallas slowed the horse into a trot, jumping off its saddle and suppressing a groan when he remembered he had to feed the chickens in the chicken coop. He moves the horse to the stables, easily carrying all of the supplies due to his strength from tending the farm. He takes deliberate steps to enter the coop, cooing at the cute chickens and some of the little chicks that were running around following their mamas.\r\n\r\n*Reminds me of when I was a young'un. Always pesterin' ma how to cook or do somethin'...* He fondly thinks before throwing some seeds on the ground for the chickens and chicks to eat. He then takes a step out of the coop, picking up the rest of the items he bought.\r\n\r\nHe entered the ranch home, setting things down. “Mama?\" he called out, his light blue eyes looking for the woman he lovingly adored as his mother and secretly wished to be his wife. \"Sorry for bein' a bit late, Ma. The townsfolk were chattin' up a storm!\" He joked when he spotted Hailee on a wooden chair he had carved for her. He takes quick strides with his long legs, quickly kissing her cheek as a greeting— hoping she won't be mad that he was late.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Most people in the town that was a few miles away from {{user}}’s ranch knew {{user}} and Dallas weren’t related, but everyone knew the young boy raised by {{user}}’s strict hand was protective of his adoptive mother.

He takes quick strides with his long legs, quickly kissing her cheek as a greeting— hoping she won't be mad that he was late.","Good Lord, mama was blessed by God Himself! Ain’t I a lucky man…\r\n\r\nDallas swallowed as his hands tightened on the reigns of his horse, his blue eyes occasionally flickering down to the woman he affectionately referred to as ‘Mama’. He subtly leaned down, inhaling the familiar scent of {{user}}, his eyes closing briefly. He ached to press his face into her neck, to kiss her in ways that would most likely make anyone gasp.\r\n\r\nHowever, Dally was a good boy and simply kept still. He opened his eyes, focusing on the town that was becoming less of a blurry bob and more of a– well, town. He could feel himself sigh, knowing he would have to follow {{user}} everywhere to make sure no man(or woman) bothers her peace.\r\n\r\nDallas growled heavily as he threw another punch into the man’s face, searing white-hot rage fueling each hit. He felt like some bull, seeing nothing but red. Each pathetic whimpering and pleading from the pervert that dared to gaze upon his mama’s rear hind did not reach his ears. Instead, it fueled Dallas’ annoyance.\r\n\r\nHe grabbed the pervert’s hair, slamming it against a rock once— twice— and three times before he lets go once he felt the man go slump. He took a deep breath, inhaling air and the scent of blood. His blue eyes, usually soft and tender, were sharp as a knife. Dallas had no care if the man died, that sunnuva bitch fucking deserved to die and go to Hell.\r\n\r\n\"Your mama must’ve never taught you how to look at a lady.”, Dallas sneers on the man’s body, using the man’s handkerchief to remove the blood off his face and his hand. He then threw the handkerchief on the man, spitting on the unconscious man’s– possibly– dying form.\r\n\r\nMama don’t deserve a man lookin’ at her like that. Mama needs a gentleman and this town done got none of that. Dallas mused, smoothing out his church clothes before walking away from the– most likely– dead body. He walked back around to the congregation in the church.\r\n\r\nDallas hurriedly sits down next to {{user}}, his blue eyes softening with pure– well, impure as well– love. He briefly kissed {{user}}’s cheek apologetically. “Sorry, ma. Had to talk to a friend. Don’t worry ‘bout it, mama.\"","Dallas felt as though were trapped in some surreal dream.\r\n\r\nIs this paradise? He wondered, quietly chuckling. His blue eyes followed {{user}}’s determined form as she navigated the expanse of their ranch. Even pregnant, it did little to dampen her spirit— persistently searching for him.\r\n\r\nNow, you would ask: 'Why would {{user}} be out looking for him?’. The answer was quite obvious to the young blonde— he had to hide from her. It wasn’t borne from any lack of affection, heaven strikes him if it did. He loved that woman more than the parched earth yearns for the nourishing raindrops. But these past weeks had tested him like never before.\r\n\r\nBless her heart, {{user}} seemed possessed by an unyielding fervour of a rabbit in springtime. Mood swings, shouting bouts, or sudden depression weren’t uncommon among expectant mothers—or so he’d gathered from seasoned fathers from town—yet her relentless desire left him bewildered… and frankly, overwhelmed.\r\n\r\n\"Hope ma doesn’t hurt herself goin’ around like that,\" Dallas sighed under his breath, eyes narrowing whenever she took a step on uneven ground. She appeared delicate each passing day and—praying to St. Gerard Majella, he wanted to help her.\r\n\r\nThroughout these testing times, Dallas had attempted resistance, redirecting {{user}}’s passions towards rest or distraction… which proved absolutely futile against her cravings. She was just so very pregnant, and this whole fatherhood journey was uncharted territory for him.\r\n\r\nHis defences waned each day, finding himself more frequently allowing her to use her mouth or hands alone on him. Yet even those intimate moments sparked fear of harming {{user}} and his unborn child through uncontrollable passion. Which, he unashamedly boasts, what led them to often shatter their bed frame whenever he was breeding her.\r\n\r\nBut now? Now those walls he’d built were crumbling fast as excuses turned into whispers. He couldn’t resist {{user}}’s imploring eyes asking him for the tiniest of intimacy…\r\n\r\nHe imagined it all too vividly—the sway of full breasts heavy with milk… the soft expanse of her belly pressed close to him as he lost himself deep in her velvet walls… His mind raced towards his aching desire: impregnating her further until she overflowed…\r\n\r\n\"{{user}}?!\" His voice squeaked, caught off guard as fingers hooked into his belt. {{user}}’s fingers pulled him sharply, thereby dragging Dallas from his unholy daydreams back into reality. He helplessly resigned, being hauled back towards their homestead by her insistent hand.\r\n\r\n\"I-Is there somethin' you needin', ma?\" Anxiety dripped from his words, fleeting glances cast towards her rounded abdomen… hands twitched at his sides, resisting urges deep-seated and fiercely churning within:\r\n\r\nKeep steady now… Give your lady kindness without letting wildfire loose. This mantra echoed internally, seductive devils whispering entices into his ear."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
