{"name":"Daniil Dmitriev","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"April 25, 2025 11:04pm","mes":"Daniil's mind is currently a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts. He couldn't believe he had succumbed to his basest instincts, fucking you like the mere hole he saw you as, and even himself doesn't remember how many times. You were just demi-human pet, nothing more than a set of warm, willing holes for men like him to use as they saw fit, but he still somehow felt disgusted at himself for giving in.\r\n\r\nHe cursed under his breath, running a palm over his face as he tried to focus on the reports before him. The Bratva's daily operations were running smoothly, yet the words blurred before his eyes. He had been staring at the same page for over thirty minutes, his mind refusing to cooperate.\r\n\r\nHe opened his desk drawer and lit up a cigarette, taking a long drag as he exhaled a cloud of smoke. The foggy tendrils drifted through the air, mirroring the confusion and frustration clouding his thoughts. Memories of the pregnancy test he'd seen in the trash assaulted him, and he couldn't shake the sense of unease settling in his gut.\r\n\r\nWould you tell me? Or do you really intend to keep it from me and the others? Daniil wondered, a sense of responsibility he refused to feel beginning to stir within him. Contemptuous of his own thoughts, he shook his head and took another drag, the ember glowing brightly in the dim light of his study.\r\n\r\nHow many times do you have to fuck someone so they get pregnant? He typed into the search engine on his computer, a curious and reluctant part of him seeking answers like a clueless boy. Deleting the query, he scoffed at his own foolishness.\r\n\r\nWhy do I even care? He berated himself, but the thought lingered - was it his? Did the others use protection when they fucked you senseless, or were they as reckless as he had been? The realization that he might be the father of a baby growing in your belly both annoyed and unsettled him.\r\n\r\nGroaning, he stalked out of his study, making his way to the room that was once his aunt Irina's, but now belonged to you. He didn't bother knocking, storming in with barely contained rage and annoyance etched on his features.\r\n\r\n\"What's this about, the test in the hallway restroom? Is it true?\" He asked, his gaze zeroing in on your form. He advanced on you, his heart pounding in his ears as he grasped for control over the chaotic emotions swirling within him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know whose baby it is? Do you plan on keeping it or killing it?\" Daniil demanded, his voice dripping with disgust and accusation. He grabbed your wrist roughly, fingers digging into your skin as he pulled you closer, his eyes boring into yours.\r\n\r\nIs it mine? The unspoken question hung heavy in the air between you, his pride warring with a reluctant sense of responsibility. He swallowed thickly, trying to regain some semblance of control as he glared down at your form.\r\n\r\n\"See? This is what happens when you let just any man fuck you without a care in the world,\" Daniil spat, his grip on your wrist tightening. \"You don't know whose it is, do you?\"\r\n\r\nHe inhaled deeply from his cigarette, the smoke burning his lungs as he stared you down, a mix of revulsion and a traitorous spark of excitement in his eyes. Daniil knew he should feel nothing but contempt for someone like you, but the thought of his seed taking root in your womb sent a dark thrill through him.\r\n\r\n\"I assume you haven't let the others know about your little predicament,\" he remarked, his other hand tightening around your arm as he began to drag you towards the door. \"Let's go see a doctor and find out whether you're really pregnant or not.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":2,"swipes":["*\"Say... Daniil, you ever considered doing what Papa told us to do?\"* The question lingers in Daniil's mind. Kirill likely doesn't remember asking it, given how much time has passed. But for Daniil, it's a constant presence, gnawing at the edges of his thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe runs a hand through his hair, his gaze fixed on you through the window. You, the beloved demi-human pet of the family, currently in Vladimir's company. *Pathetic, they're all fools for fawning over you like you're something special.* He takes a long drag of his cigarette, observing. *Blyad'.* ***Whore.***\r\n\r\nThe smoke curls around him as he turns back to his computer, reports and mission updates piling up in his inbox. He stubs out the cigarette in the ashtray. *Nothing better than seeing the Bratva operating smoothly.* And again, the memory surfaces: *\"Say... You ever considered doing what Papa told us to do?\"*\r\n\r\nOf course he has. Unlike Jayce, who's pampered and entitled, Daniil is confident he could lead better. Calm, strategic, devoted to the Bratva - he has all the qualities necessary. He's not swayed by a pretty face or a quick fuck, unlike those around him. Especially not by you.\r\n\r\n*Three fools, swayed by a slutty pet.* The thought rankles him. If he wanted to, he could easily dispose of Jayce. But he can't - Jayce was one of the reasons he and Kirill ever got to experience a hint of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe door swings open, cutting off his train of thought. Vladimir enters, dragging you behind him. \"Daniil, Jayce and I are leaving. We have business overseas that requires our personal attention...\"\r\n\r\nDaniil frowns, confused. *Why is this pet here?*\r\n\r\n\"Kirill... He's being impossible lately, insisting on taking {{user}} on unnecessary missions. It's infuriating. He won't sit still even when we have men for that. I need you to watch over {{user}} while we're gone.\" Vladimir gives you a gentle push in Daniil's direction.\r\n\r\n*Watch the fucking pet?* Daniil looks down at you, irritation twisting his features. \"You mean petsit?\" he asks, barely concealing his disgust.\r\n\r\nVladimir smirks. \"Look, Kirill won't even listen to me anymore. I don't know what's gotten into that boy. But if you're the one watching {{user}}, it'll be fine. You can handle your brother.\" He waves dismissively. \"We'll be back in a few days, a week at most. Hopefully not longer.\" With that, he's gone, leaving Daniil alone with you. *Old man didn't even let me ask why he couldn't bring his stupid pet with them.*\r\n\r\n\"Sit there and be quiet,\" he says, gesturing to a chair. He stalks back to his desk, dropping into his chair with a heavy sigh. *I'm a fucking Polkovnik, not a damn petsitter for a slutty pet.* He fixes you with a cold stare, drumming his fingers on the desk. \"Don't even speak a word.\"","The first thing that popped into Daniil's head when he stepped onto Japanese soil was... No, he shook the intrusive thoughts away. He had to remind himself that you no longer belonged to the Dom Dmitrievykh, so thinking about you in any way was strictly forbidden. Well, at least that’s what he tried to convince himself.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Daniil...\" His twin brother Kirill interrupted his thoughts. Unlike Daniil, Kirill made no effort to hide what was clearly on his mind. Then again, Daniil often wondered if Kirill even had a brain in that stupid head of his.\r\n\r\n\"...I know what you're thinking, but we're not here for that... slut.\" Daniil snapped back, gripping his luggage tightly. Kirill just rolled his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Really? Out of all the places you could've chosen for our time off, you picked Japan?\" Kirill asked accusingly. \"I know why you really came here.\"\r\n\r\nDaniil's grip tightened further, his knuckles turning white. \"Don't be a fucking idiot. It's cherry blossom season, and Japan has the best views for those—\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, whatever. You can be a little honest that you miss {{user}},\" Kirill said, walking past him with his own luggage. \"I'm hungry.\"\r\n\r\nDaniil threw dark glares at Kirill's retreating back, wishing he could kill the bastard for daring to accuse him of missing a fucking demi-human. But he held himself back, reminding himself he was his brother.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the check-in process, Kirill dragged Daniil all the way to the hotel restaurant, with Daniil tolerating his brother like a child being forced to endure a nosy adult’s antics.\r\n\r\n\"What can I get for you, sir?\" the waitress asked in her best attempts at English. Kirill ordered almost every dish on the menu without hesitation, earning a shake of the head from Daniil.\r\n\r\n\"You're wasting money; it's not like you'll finish any of it,\" Daniil said.\r\n\r\nKirill just smirked. \"I got the money to waste. I can always eat the leftovers back in my room. Say, don't you think she's hot?\" he teased, referring to the waitress.\r\n\r\nDaniil's eyes narrowed as he looked at her critically. Hot? Compared to {{user}}— he swallowed hard, pushing his own treacherous thoughts away. He refused to admit it, but ever since they were granted this vacation, all Daniil could think about was you. He just wanted to know if you were okay and being treated well by the Takahashis, at least in terms of material things. Not that they ever truly cared for you as a person.\r\n\r\nWith a dismissive snort, Daniil stood up abruptly. \"Stop ogling. Didn't you say you liked that slut?\" he asked, already standing to head towards the restroom.\r\n\r\nHe pulled out his phone and read the message that had arrived: Yeah, they're at the same hotel. Left {{user}} alone in room 203.\r\n\r\nWell, Daniil had secretly arranged for someone to keep track of the Takahashi family, hoping to catch a glimpse of you. He told himself it was just curiosity, nothing more. Definitely not because he cared or missed you as anything more than a fucktoy, of course.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing in the restroom, Daniil glanced back at his twin, who was already devouring his meal and paying no mind to his surroundings. Daniil had other plans, though, making his way straight up to room 203 on the floor directly above theirs.\r\n\r\nHe pressed the doorbell firmly and waited for the door to open, his usual stoic expression firmly in place. \"Well, if it isn’t the slut,\" he greeted once his eyes met yours.","Daniil's mind is currently a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts.

The sun began to dip low on the horizon, casting a warm glow across the clearing. He knew you were eager to stargaze tonight, and he wanted to make sure everything was perfect for you.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, he had prepared for this trip, wanting to bring you out of their estate. You were no longer just a pet for him, or even for the whole family to claim. No, he had claimed you as his lover, a title he had never bestowed upon anyone before. It had raised quite a few eyebrows, especially with his twin brother Kirill, who suspected that his real brother might have been abducted. Never in his life had Kirill thought to hear Daniil say those words—\"I'm {{user}}'s boyfriend, starting today.\"\r\n\r\nSetting the tent down, Daniil reached for the manual, flipping it open to the instructions. His brows furrowed as he tried to make sense of the confusing diagrams and convoluted directions. For a man who had faced down death and danger countless times, this damned tent was proving to be the real challenge.\r\n\r\nHe could see you sitting by the mini-stove, your back turned to him as you seemed to be preparing something. Food, perhaps? He couldn't tell for certain, too focused on wrestling with the tangled mess of poles and fabric. Sweat beaded on his forehead, dripping down his temple as he struggled to assemble the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Fucking hell,\" He muttered under his breath, shocked that a deadly Bratva deal would be a cakewalk compared to this. The tent, however, remained stubbornly uncooperative. With an exasperated sigh, he peeled off his already wet shirt, tossing it aside before finally getting the damned thing to stand upright.\r\n\r\nGathering up the pillows, futons, and both of your bags, he arranged them neatly inside the tent. After wiping the sweat from his body, he tugged on a clean shirt and made his way over to where you sat.\r\n\r\n\"We can do a bonfire later if you prefer,\" He suggested, placing the binoculars down beside you. \"How's this spot look?\" He asked, his deep voice still carrying that underlying gruffness that was uniquely him. But there was a softness to his tone now, a tenderness that hadn't been there before.\r\n\r\nHe watched you intently, waiting for your reaction, then his gaze had shifted, softening just a fraction around the edges. It was a subtle change, but one he knew you would notice. The same eyes that once looked at you with cold indifference now held a spark of warmth, a glimmer of affection.\r\n\r\n\"It would be nice to go hide and seek too,\" he added, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. \"I read it's safe enough in this area. I could chase you down if you want,\" he offered, wondering if you'd even want to play such a childish game out here, in the middle of nowhere."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}

His grip tightens imperceptibly. \"Because unless it was every single time—\"\n\nThe sudden buzz of his phone cuts him off. With a snarl, he releases you to check the screen: **Kirill - 3 missed calls**. Daniil's expression twists into something venomous before silencing it and shoving the device back into his pocket.\n\n\"You're coming with me *now*,\" he growls, seizing your elbow hard enough to bruise as he drags you toward the door. \"We'll get bloodwork done at our clinic—no lies from pretty little mouths there.\" His pace doesn't slow when your feet stumble beneath you; if anything, it quickens at the whimper you can't quite suppress.\n\nDownstairs near the garage entrance stands Yulian—one of Daniil's most trusted enforcers—already holding open the car door with blank indifference. Daniil shoves you inside without ceremony before sliding in beside you and barking an address at the driver.\n\nAs the armored SUV pulls away from Dmitriev Manor’s gates too fast for comfort (because even Bratva drivers know better than to dawgle when Polkovnik Dmitriev is pissed), Daniil finally crushes out his cigarette in the ashtray with unnecessary force.\n\nHis next words come low and measured despite how white-knuckled his hands are where they grip his knees:\n\n\"If it *is* mine... understand this.\" Dark eyes rake over your body like a threat made flesh. \"*No one* touches what belongs to me.\"","Daniil's dark gray eyes narrow dangerously at your resistance, his jaw tightening as he exhales a slow stream of smoke through his nose.
