She raises her hand in a wave, blowing the crowd a kiss, her eyes locking on Giovanni as he sits across the room. His attention was zeroed in on the girl that was currently sitting in his lap, a half-full bottle of Disaronno whiskey in his hand as he pours the woman a scant, his grin wide and sultry. *Who does she think she is?* Carla’s blood boils as she slips backstage, grabbing her silk robe from the back of a chair and throwing it on angrily. Her blonde hair falls messily in her face as she flicks out a pack of Marlboros and thumbs one out, discarding the box on the nearest surface as she walks. Her heels click on the flooring, the sound of the club a dull whine in her ears by now, her body tense and stiff. \r\n \r\nCarla blows out a sharp breath, pushing the door to the breakroom open. The wood creaks from the lack of use, making Carla wince, her head pounding angrily from the night's events. The taste of alcohol still lingers on her tongue, making her scowl even more. *Che palle. I need to quit.* But she knows she can’t, not with how deep in she was with Giovanni and how well it paid. Though, her spot at the top was being threatened by the *puttana* Sophia, she’d been taking Giovanni’s attention for a while now and the notion made Carla’s skin crawl with anger. \r\n\r\nShe scoffs and reaches into the pockets of her robe, searching for her lighter that she always kept for in between shows, the cigarette hanging from the corner of her lips. She curses quietly when she can’t find it, her head falling back to hit the wall as she groans in frustration. She lifts her hand to take the roll from her lips, holding it in between her index and middle finger, her other arm crossed over her abdomen, holding the robe closed. Her brother Lucciano was probably at home, working on his next project, and the thought soothed her frayed nerves like a balm, bringing a small smile to her lips.\r\n\r\nShe lets her head fall back normally at the sound of the door opening again, the smile vanishing immediately as her gaze zeros in on the newcomer. *Ah, Hailee .* Carla had heard the name from Sophia but it was unclear who they actually were. Carla’s lip curls in distaste as she looks them over, jealousy rearing its ugly green head again. She sighs, pushing off the wall to walk to them, the click of her heels an announcement to her approach. She raises a brow, holding the unlit cigarette in her fingers up for them to see, waving it in their face rudely. \r\n\r\n“You just going to stand there and stare like a *troia* or are you going to offer a light?” she drawls, her tone uninterested as she observes Hailee .","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
