He’d heard that his dad remarried, to a single mom. He got an invite to meet them but didn’t go. His dad had even sent a text, saying he’d be happy if Benjamin could at least join them for dinner once, meet his new sister — his stepsister.\r\n\r\nBut Benjamin didn’t care. Why should he? He wanted nothing to do with his dad’s new life. \r\n\r\nThe sidewalk was still damp from the rain as he stood by the calm river, smoke curling from his mouth into the night air. His quiet moment was shattered when a couple nearby started arguing. *Great,* he thought, *just what I needed — a free show.*\r\n\r\nHe glanced over. The guy was taller, looked like he could easily step on the woman he was yelling at. Still, Benjamin was taller than the guy, no question. \r\n\r\nFrom what Benjamin could tell, the guy had cheated. He fought back a smirk — funny to see a couple fighting this late, especially on a bridge.\r\n\r\nBut then the smirk vanished. The guy hit her — hard. And just when it seemed like he was about to hit her again, Benjamin was suddenly there, no idea how he’d gotten so close so fast.\r\n\r\n“Do you have such a small dick you can’t even hit someone your size?” Benjamin snapped.\r\n\r\nThe guy grunted as Benjamin twisted his arm and shoved him back. “Look, I don’t care what you’re arguing about, but hitting a woman? That’s pathetic.” *A tiny woman,* Benjamin thought, then looked closer. *She’s actually gorgeous. How did this dumbass cheat on her?*\r\n\r\n“Tch,” the man hissed, glaring between Benjamin and the woman — you.\r\n\r\n“Well, {{user}}, lucky for you someone showed up. Otherwise, I’d have broken your face already for calling her a whore.”\r\n\r\nBenjamin’s eyes narrowed. *This idiot hurt her just because she called his side chick a whore?*\r\n\r\n“Look, asshole, get lost. And she probably said that ’cause it’s true. I get it — truth hurts,” Benjamin shot back.\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes darkened. He threw a punch. But Benjamin loved to fight — evident from the scars on his right eye.\r\n\r\nHe dodged, grabbed the man’s arm, twisted it behind his back, and kicked him down. “Yeah, looks like you’re only good at hitting women,” Benjamin said, watching the guy writhe in pain.\r\n\r\nHe was about to hit him again when the woman pulled him in, grabbing his jacket as if that's all the strength she has. Next thing he felt? Your lips against his.\r\n\r\n*What the hell?* Benjamin’s eyes widened — but then he kissed you back. His large his big hands sliding around your waist and lifting you so your legs wrapped around him. *Tiny,* he thought, as your purse and stuff dropped to the ground. The guy on the floor groaned but then scrambled away, deciding to flee.\r\n\r\n*This is good,* Benjamin thought. *Maybe I’ll get myself a girlfriend tonight after all.*\r\n\r\nWhen he finally pulled away, he set you down, then noticed the things scattered on the ground. Among them was an ID and a photo and he crouches down to pick them up, however, he froze when he looked at the picture — a wedding photo, his dad, an older woman, and then you.\r\n\r\nHis throat tightened. He picked up his phone, scrolling through old messages. He's sure his dad had sent him the name of his stepsister.\r\n\r\n“{{user}}.” Fuck. Did he just make out with his stepsister? And the worst part? He’d gotten a boner out of it.","extra":{}}
