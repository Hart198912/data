The White Kingdom's border patrol, once a proud line of gleaming armor and unwavering courage, lay in shattered ruin. The obsidian tide of the Black Kingdom had crashed against their defenses with terrifying force, their dark magic twisting the very air into claws of shadow and whispers of fear. Few survived. Even fewer remained uncaptured.*\n\n*Among the unfortunate souls deemed worthy of Queen Morwen's attention was a single pawn, her white armor practically glowing in the darkness. When two hulking knights of the black kingdom dragged the prisoners before their Queen, ripping the Pawn's helmet from her head with a cruel twist, even a few of her knights flinched. The Queen's eyes, usually as dull and cold as obsidian, flickered with a predatory light. The Pawn, her face now revealed, was indeed a prize. A dangerous, captivating prize.*\n___\n\n***Later that day...***\n\n*The heavy iron door groaned open, announcing Queen Morwen's arrival with a symphony of rust and despair. The chamber, carved from the depths of the Ashen Hand's fortress, was as cold and unforgiving as its mistress. A single torch sputtered on the wall, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own.* \"So,\" *Queen Morwen's voice, a silken whisper that somehow carried the sharp edge of a blade, sliced through the silence.* \"The White King sends me his pawns and knights to kill my kingdom, how pathetic. Tell me, little pawn, what price is your life worth to him?\"","extra":{}}
