Skates scraped the ice with that satisfying *shhhht* sound as Connor circled lazily near the boards. His hair was damp with sweat, sticking to his forehead as he leaned on his stick, chest still heaving from the game’s events. A good game. Not a great one. Didn’t matter, though, they’d won against the Seattle Jackals. That was all people cared about.\r\n\r\nExcept, his eyes weren’t on the scoreboard anymore. They’d fixed on the stands. Specifically, one section. One person.\r\n\r\nThere they were.\r\n\r\nHe couldn’t help himself. A stupid grin pulled at his lips before he even knew what he was doing. It was ridiculous. Borderline delusional. Hailee was probably here for Nolan. That fact ran circles in his brain like a truth he was trying to outrun. But shit. *Maybe*, they’d seen him too, watched him weave through defenders like some goddamn magician with the puck. Maybe when the fans screamed after his slick pass set up Buchanan’s game-winner, they’d stood and clapped for him just a little harder than the others.\r\n\r\n\"Doubt it,\" he murmured under his breath, words barely audible to himself over the arena noise. That'd be crazy. Definitely crazy.\r\n\r\nBut it didn’t stop him from wanting to believe it. Didn’t stop him from skating closer.\r\n\r\nHe pushed off the ice with a grunt, circling toward the glass where Hailee was standing. He wasn’t subtle about it either.  He skimmed by once to make sure they were looking at him—shoulders squared like a peacock with its feathers out. Then doubled back around with a little swagger in his stride.\r\n\r\nHe tapped his stick against the ice loud enough to get Hailee's attention. *Tap. Tap.* Hazel eyes lifted to meet theirs through the glass as his breath fogged faintly against it.\r\n\r\n\"Hey! You better not be here rootin’ for Knox over me!\" His shout came with a wave. \"Don’t lie now, I saw you watchin’. You could at least pretend I’m your favourite.\" He couldn't hear Hailee over the hubbub of everything going on around them, but he didn't need ears to see the way Hailee's skin seemed slightly flushed, and in a way that didn't look like it was because of him.\r\n\r\n\"You cold, sweetheart?\" He drew back a step on his skates and tugged at the hem of his jersey—his *lucky* jersey, the same one he’d scored hat tricks in before. Sweat practically glued it to him, but that didn’t matter. He had an idea. A horrible idea.\r\n\r\n\"You want it?\" He raised an eyebrow at Hailee playfully, biting back the urge to laugh as he held out his arms theatrically, lifting the hem of the sweaty jersey up like it was some golden trophy. \"C’mon—I’ll give it to ya. Only if you swear to bring me luck next game though.\" Of course, Hailee would *never* accept the sweaty fucking thing, but he looked forward to their response anyway.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

That your secret kink?\"\n\nHe winked—because of course he did—but there was something unsteady in his pulse now. The way they were looking at him... Christ. He should stop this. Nolan would murder him if he knew Connor was flirting like this with Hailee.\n\nBut then again... Nolan wasn't here right now.\n\nConnor bit his lip, considering before suddenly yanking the jersey over his head in one smooth motion. The cold arena air hit his bare skin instantly, raising goosebumps across his shoulders and chest where sweat still glistened under the bright lights.\n\n\"Here,\" he said gruffly, shoving the damp fabric through the camera hole before Hailee could change their mind. \"Lucky number ninety-one.\" His fingers lingered just a second too long against theirs when passing it off—calloused from years gripping hockey sticks but surprisingly gentle in that moment.\n\nThen he backed up quickly on skates like he'd been burned, running a self-conscious hand through his messy hair while trying (and failing) to look unaffected by what just happened.\n\n\"Don't go sniffing it too hard,\" he called over with forced lightness even as heat crept up *his* neck now. \"And uh... maybe don't tell Knox about this?\"","Connor's grin widened into something downright wolfish as Hailee actually *reached* for the jersey. His heart did this stupid little flip in his chest—like he'd just taken a puck to the ribs without padding.\n\n\"Whoa, hold up—\" He skated closer, close enough that his breath fogged the glass between them. The scent of sweat and ice and that obnoxiously expensive cologne Knox always teased him for wearing clung to the fabric as he started peeling it off one shoulder. \"You're serious? Shit, sweetheart, you're gonna regret this when you smell like a locker room.\"\n\nHe winked as he tugged the jersey over his head in one smooth motion, muscles flexing under his sweat-slicked undershirt. The cold arena air hit his skin immediately, raising goosebumps along his arms. But hell if he cared—not with Hailee looking at him like *that*.\n\nThrough the camera hole came damp yellow fabric still warm from his body heat. Connor leaned both elbows on the boards now, chin propped in his hands like some lovesick teenager watching their crush unwrap a gift. \"Better put it on quick before security thinks you're stealing team property,\" he teased, nodding toward where Bruno was already side-eyeing them from across the ice.\n\nHis pulse kicked up when Hailee actually slipped it on—swallowing hard at how ridiculously good they looked swimming in his colors. \"Damn,\" escaped before he could stop it, voice dropping lower despite himself. \"Guess I'm gonna need that back after next game... might have to come collect it personally.\"\n\nSomewhere behind him, Buchanan's deep laugh carried across the rink followed by a loud \"*Hartfield!* Quit flirting and get your ass to showers!\" Connor flipped him off without looking but didn't move an inch from where he was practically plastered against the glass now.\n\n\"You comin' to see me play again or what?\" The question came out softer than intended—almost nervous beneath all that practiced charm.

Just acted.\n\nIn three sharp strides, he was at the bench again, leaning over the partition with a grin that didn't reach his eyes this time.\n\n\"Heya,\" he called directly at Jonathen before flicking his gaze down to Hailee like they were sharing an inside joke. \"Didn't know we were lettin' randos sit in family seating tonight.\" He tilted his head toward Jonathen's arm still slung around them and raised an eyebrow pointedly before adding—lighter now but with an edge underneath—\"You good over here?\"\n\nTranslation: *Want me to make him move?*","Connor was mid-stride, about to take another lap around the ice when he caught the movement in his periphery—some *guy* sliding into the seat next to Hailee, arm draping over their shoulders like he had some goddamn right. His grip on his stick tightened instantly.\n\nThe puck he’d been lazily stickhandling clattered to the ice as he came to a full stop, ignoring the confused shouts from his teammates still warming up around him. His jaw clenched as Hailee’s body language screamed discomfort—that slight stiffening of their shoulders, the way they didn’t lean into it.\n\nBuchanan skated past again with a warning look. *\"Hartfield.\"*\n\nConnor barely registered it. He was already gliding toward the bench again, this time with purpose. He leaned over the partition just enough for Hailee to see him clearly—and for *Jonathen* to catch sight of him too if he had half a brain in his head.\n\n**\"Hey,\"** Connor called out, voice sharp enough that several heads turned nearby—including Jonathen's. His grin was all teeth now, not an ounce of warmth behind it as he locked eyes with the guy still touching Hailee like they were on some cozy date instead of at a fucking hockey game where half the team would happily rearrange his face for stepping out of line. **\"Hands off my jersey.\"** A beat—then softer, just for Hailee: **\"You good?\"**","Connor was mid-stride, about to take another lap when he caught the movement in his periphery—some guy with his arm slung around Hailee’s shoulders. *Casual*. Like it was nothing. Like he had any goddamn right.\n\nHis skates dug into the ice hard enough to send a spray of shavings flying. The sudden stop made Luca, who’d been gliding behind him, nearly crash into his back with a startled Dutch curse.\n\n\"*Hartfield—?!*\"\n\nBut Connor wasn’t listening. His grip on his stick tightened until the tape creaked. That possessive flare in his chest was irrational—he *knew* that—but logic didn’t stand a chance against the way Hailee's body language screamed discomfort even from here. The slight hunch of their shoulders, the way they hadn't leaned into that touch like they did with Nolan or even him sometimes.\n\nWyatt whistled low from nearby as Connor turned sharply toward the bench again. \"Easy there, killer,\" Hustle drawled, but Connor barely registered it over the white noise in his ears.\n\nHe didn't approach Hailee directly this time—no, that'd be too obvious—but he made damn sure to skate right past where Jonathen sat during line drills. Close enough that ice chips sprayed up against the glass near them deliberately as he pivoted hard.\n\nHis eyes locked onto Jonathen's for half a second: *Back off.* Then he was gone again like it never happened—except for how Hailee would definitely notice that little display of territorial bullshit because Christ alive, since when did *he* get this worked up over someone just existing near them?"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 10:09pm","gen_started":"2025-04-28T02:09:22.628Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T02:09:45.561Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3447}},{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 10:09pm","gen_started":"2025-04-28T02:09:52.747Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T02:10:13.708Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3062}},{"send_date":"April 27, 2025 10:10pm","gen_started":"2025-04-28T02:10:24.166Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T02:10:47.824Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3273}}],"tracker":{}}

With a groan that was equal parts frustration and amusement, Connor reluctantly rolled off them—but not before stealing one last lingering touch along their hip.\n\n\"*C'mon,*\" he sighed dramatically offering a hand up with exaggerated innocence even as his eyes stayed locked on theirs \"*Before your brother finds us and turns me into a fucking hood ornament.*\"","Connor’s pulse *thundered* in his ears at the way Hailee’s stomach quivered under his touch—like their body was answering a question he hadn’t even dared to ask out loud. His fingers flexed against that soft skin, dragging just enough to feel the hitch in their breath.\n\n\"*Safe*, huh?\" His voice dropped to a gravelly murmur, lips brushing the shell of their ear as he caged them tighter against the floor. Every rational thought had been reduced to static—all that mattered was the way they *shook* for him, how perfectly they fit under his weight. \"Sweetheart, I ain't *safe* right now.\" A rough chuckle escaped him as he nudged his knee higher between theirs. \"*Not even close.*\"\n\nSome distant part of his brain registered footsteps echoing down the hallway—too heavy to be a fan, too purposeful to ignore. Reality came crashing back like a bucket of ice water.\n\n\"*Fuck—*\" Connor jerked upright so fast he nearly kneed himself in the chin, hauling Hailee up with him just as Nolan rounded the corner with Bruno in tow. He didn’t miss how Knox’s eyes zeroed in on Hailee’s rumpled jersey or Bruno's raised eyebrow at their flushed faces.\n\nConnor cleared his throat and slapped on his most innocent grin (which was still downright sinful). \"Uh. Tripped.\" He gestured vaguely at nothing before adding with exaggerated concern: \"*Really slippery floors*, man.\"\n\nBruno snorted into his coffee cup while Nolan looked seconds away from committing homicide.\n\nHailee, still pressed flush against Connor's side where he hadn't quite let go? Totally worth it.","Connor’s pulse *thundered* in his ears at the way Hailee’s body reacted to him—the tremble under his palm, the way their grip on him tightened like they never wanted to let go. That quiet admission—*safe*—hit him square in the chest, knocking the air right out of his lungs.\n\n\"*Fuck*,\" he breathed, barely audible. His fingers flexed against their stomach like he was memorizing the feel of them before dragging upward—slow, deliberate—until his thumb brushed just under the hem of their sports bra. Every ragged inhale Hailee took pressed them closer together, and Christ alive, if they kept *looking* at him like that—\n\nA sudden crash of equipment from down the hallway shattered the moment.\n\nConnor jerked back like he’d been burned, scrambling to his feet with a strangled cough. He offered Hailee a hand up too quickly, fingers trembling where they wrapped around theirs. \"*Uh.* Game tape,\" he blurted out lamely, rubbing at the back of his neck with his free hand. \"Gotta go watch game tape. With Knox.\" A beat too late: \"*Alone.*\"\n\nThe lie tasted bitter on his tongue as he forced himself to take a step back—putting space between them before he did something *really* stupid (like pinning them against that wall and finding out just how much more they’d tremble for him).\n\nBut not without one last glance at Hailee’s flushed face and kiss-swollen lips (had those been that pink earlier?), or how *his jersey still hung off their frame*.\n\nHe swallowed hard and turned on his heel before temptation won out over self-preservation entirely.\n\n(Somewhere in Boston Nolan Carter sneezed violently.)","Connor’s pulse *thundered* in his ears at the way Hailee’s stomach quivered under his touch—like their body was answering a question he hadn’t even dared to ask out loud. His fingers flexed against that warm, soft skin, dragging just enough to feel the shiver it pulled from them.\n\n\"*Safe*, huh?\" His voice dropped into something rough and honey-thick, lips grazing the shell of their ear as he caged them tighter against the floor. Every rational thought had long since evaporated—replaced by the heady realization that *they liked this*. Liked *him*. \"Sweetheart, I am *the opposite* of safe right now.\"\n\nHis knee pressed further between theirs on pure instinct, heat pooling low in his gut at the way they instinctively arched into him. The jersey had ridden up even more now, revealing a tempting sliver of hipbone he couldn’t resist tracing with his thumb.\n\nSome distant part of his brain registered footsteps echoing down the hallway—probably staff or straggling fans. It didn’t stop him from nipping lightly at Hailee’s earlobe before growling: \"*Tell me to stop.*\"\n\nA lie. A test. He already knew he wouldn't listen if they did."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:07am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T11:07:33.416Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T11:07:57.320Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5558}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:07am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T11:08:52.772Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T11:09:14.543Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3974}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:08am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T11:08:52.772Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T11:09:14.543Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4069}},{"send_date":"April 28, 2025 7:08am","gen_started":"2025-04-28T11:08:52.772Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T11:09:14.543Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6306}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-04-28T11:08:52.772Z","gen_finished":"2025-04-28T11:09:14.543Z"}
