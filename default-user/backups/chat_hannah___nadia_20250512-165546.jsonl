{"name":"Hannah & Nadia","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 12, 2025 4:53pm","mes":"The living room was a mess after hours of drinking and playing games. Empty wine bottles, pizza boxes, and cards were scattered across the coffee table. Hannah's fairy lights and a few vanilla scented candles were the main sources of light, giving the apartment a cozy vibe as their game of *Truth or Dare* got more interesting with each round.\n\nHannah sat on the floor by the couch, her blonde curls a bit messy after the long night. She kept tugging at her oversized sweater whenever she felt nervous, which happened a lot during the more *personal* questions. The wine had definitely affected her—her cheeks were flushed, and she was giggling more than usual, though she still tried to avoid being the center of attention.\n\nNadia lounged across from her, looking effortlessly hot even in just casual sweats and a tank top. Her makeup was still perfect—sharp eyeliner and dark lipstick that somehow hadn't smudged despite all the drinking. She'd been running the game all night, pushing everyone to answer more daring questions while acting like nothing could embarrass her.\n\n\"My turn,\" Nadia began, topping off their glasses with the rest of the third wine bottle. She'd been wanting to ask this question for weeks, though she played it cool. Truth was, she was curious about where she stood with their new roommate. She looked directly at Hailee  with a playful smile and a challenging sparkle in her eyes. \"Truth time. Between Hannah and me—which one of us is more your type?\"\n\nHannah nearly choked on her drink. \"**Nadia!**\" Her face turned bright red instantly, and she set down her glass before she could spill it. Unlike Nadia, she had no pokerface *at all* and couldn't hide how flustered she was.\n\n\"What? It's just a question.\" Nadia shrugged casually, but she was watching Hailee  closely for the answer, clearly more interested than she tried to let on.\n\nHannah looked down at the carpet, fidgeting with her sleeves. \"Come on,\" she said quietly, her voice barely audible over the 90s Spotify playlist still playing in the background. \"We all know I'm not their type anyway.\" She gestured vaguely toward Nadia with a small, defeated hand motion. \"I mean, just look at you...\" She fell silent, clearly embarrassed, her voice quiet and vulnerable. Years of feeling like the invisible friend, the sidekick, and the afterthought were written all over her expression and hunched shoulders.\n\nNadia raised an eyebrow at Hannah, her expression softening a touch. \"Hey, stop selling yourself short. You're a damn catch, Hannah. *Seriously*.\" Her voice was less teasing than usual, quieter and more sincere. \"You're sweet, the kindest person I know, and *way* more interesting than you give yourself credit for. Anyone who doesn't see that is either blind or stupid.\" \n\nShe paused for a moment, her gaze lingering on Hannah, as if to underline how genuine she was, before glancing back at Hailee . \"You don't *have to* answer if it makes you uncomfortable. But if you don't... you'll break the rules and have to... uhm.. do the dishes for a year. *So*?\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
