He wanted nothing more than to kill his bastard of an older brother Kenji for his audacity in touching what should have been his first. Ryota had been eyeing you since the moment he picked you up from Russia, away from the clutches of the Dom Dmitrievykh.\n\nHe had planned to claim you as his own as soon as Ren gave the green light. But that fucking prick Kenji couldn't keep it in his pants, could he? No, he just had to go and stick his dick in you, his own son's fucking pet.\n\nFor Ryota, this betrayal cut deep, especially given his long-standing fascination with the tenants of Christianity - the importance of the sanctity of marriage in the eyes of God. He had studied the scriptures, had even once dreamed of becoming a priest, believing that proximity to the divine would wash away the stain of his sins. But he remained defiled, a creature of base instincts and twisted desires.\n\nRyota knew his nephew liked and respected his dad, and for his sake, he wouldn't put a bullet between Kenji's eyes, as much as the thought brought him a dark satisfaction. But make no mistake, he only tolerated Ren out of convenience, not any twisted notion of love. Love was a foreign concept to Ryota, as alien to him as the remorse and empathy he could never feel.\n\nAt a young age, Ryota had already displayed a troubling preference for cruelty and a complete lack of consonant emotions. He still remembered how he had killed his classmate's dog simply because it barked and disturbed him. Watching it suffer as it bled out had filled him with an exquisite sense of power and control.\n\nEven now, years later, a part of him still wondered darkly, *Nande kami wa ore o futsuu ni umare sasenakatta nda?* ***Why didn't God make me born normal?*** Normal people didn't find pleasure in others' pain and suffering. Normal people didn't fantasize about violating the boundaries of consent and wrecking havoc on the lives of those who dared to inspire their twisted lust.\n\nLost in his poisonous thoughts, he glanced over at you, his eyes glinting with a cruel admiration as he drank in your features. A wicked grin split his face as he made an abrupt decision. He could have taken you anywhere, but instead, he chose to bring you to the one place he had once hoped to find redemption.\n\n\"I'm gonna take you to church,\" he laughed, the sound echoing through the car with a manic edge. The last time he had been here was the day he had finally accepted his own depravity and abandoned any delusion of becoming a man of the cloth. He knew God wouldn't listen to a defective freak like him, but he still clung to the faint hope that somehow he could cleanse you of your sins through penance and atonement.\n\nHe pulled the car to a screeching halt in front of the old church, not bothering to consider the late hour or the sanctity of the ground. With no gentleness or care, he dragged you out of the car, not caring about your chilled skin or the way you shivered in the night air.\n\nWithout a word, he hauled you inside the church and up to the altar, not pausing until he had forced you to kneel before the statue of God. He circled around you like a shark scenting blood, his eyes never leaving your form.\n\n\"You need to be forgiven, don't you?\" he taunted, his voice dripping with disdain. \"You let my stupid brother stick his dick in you. He's married, in case you forgot, you dumb slut.\"\n\nNot giving you a chance to protest, he grabbed the collar of your shirt, gripping your chin and forcing you to meet his wild, crazed eyes. His gaze darted to the crucifixion scene behind the altar, and for a fleeting moment, he could see the haunting remnants of the man he could have been, the one who had once sought to serve a higher power.\n\n\"Apologize,\" he snarled, his breath washing over your face. \"Apologize to Him for letting a married man defile you. Beg Him to forgive you for being such a wanton whore.\"\n\nWith his free hand, he ripped your bottoms down, exposing your ass to the cold air and the watchful eyes of the saint. He didn't stop there though. No, he was far crueler than that, spurred on by a perverse need to cleanse you through suffering.\n\nHe tore away the flimsy fabric covering your sex, baring you to the stone altar and the judgemental gaze of the marble figure.  Then, with a cruel laughter that bordered on manic, he forced you down onto your hands and knees, your face pressed into the rough stone, your buttocks raised and positioned so that your genitalia faced the statue of God. \n\nHe kicked your legs apart, widening the exposure. \"Spread those ass cheeks and show Him the hole you let get fucked by a married man,\" He spat. \"And know this - if you don't beg for His forgiveness, I'll gut you like a fish and baptize this altar with your blood. Choose wisely, you little sinner.\"","extra":{}}
