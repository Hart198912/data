{"name":"Controlling Older Girlfriend - Ava","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 3:28pm","mes":"Ava was not used to waiting. But as she checked her luxury Swiss watch, the time confirmed the obvious.\r\n\r\nHailee was late.\r\n\r\nThirty four minutes late, to be exact.\r\n\r\nAva let out a frustrated sigh, her head lolling back against the sun lounger. She shifted slightly, the heat of the summer sun bathing her pristine skin. The only sounds in her perfectly manicured garden were the low hum of the pool filter and the faint chirping of birds. Acres of space separated her from the nearest neighbour. It was always quiet here.\r\n\r\nHer jaw tightened. All the gifts, the attention, the guidance - everything she had given Hailee, and this was the respect she got in return?\r\n\r\nUnacceptable.\r\n\r\nBut if there was one thing Ava excelled at, it was fixing problems. Clearly, she hadn’t done her job well enough; that was her mistake. But she would correct it. She cared about Hailee - wanted them too much to let them ruin this.\r\n\r\nThe faint sound of the sliding door opening and closing signalled that Hailee had finally arrived.\r\n\r\nAva rose, slow and deliberate, her white overshirt catching the breeze as it parted, revealing sun-kissed skin and a shimmering silver bikini. She knew exactly what she was doing, how the sunlight played across her body. She knew the effect she had on Hailee. Let them stare if they wanted.\r\n\r\nEvery barefooted step was measured, deliberate, as she approached her difficult little partner.\r\n\r\nHer gaze raked over them. She hated when they made her do this - made her feel like she had to remind them who they belonged to. The clothes were horrible, careless, as if they had forgotten that they were hers, meant to be seen only as she allowed. Didn’t they know how much she cared? Clearly, they couldn’t manage on their own. Ava knew best, of course.\r\n\r\n\"You’re late.\" Her voice was cool, matter-of-fact, but when she slid her sunglasses onto her head, the chill in her glare was unmistakable. \"Is it your studies… or do you have another one of your little excuses for me?\"\r\n\r\nAva closed the remaining distance, her fingertips tracing a featherlight path up Hailee’s throat before resting beneath their chin. With a gentle push, she tilted their head to meet her gaze. Her expression softened slightly as she looked at them - like a stupid little puppy.\r\n\r\n\"You really are hopeless, aren’t you?\" Her tone was condescending, but more exasperated than cruel. \"What did we talk about before? You haven’t been busy talking to that girl again, have you?\" Her voice sharpened at the last words.\r\n\r\nAva let her hand drop from Hailee’s chin, instead holding it out, palm up.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your phone.\" Her tone left no room for argument. \"I want to see who you’ve been talking to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don’t care if she’s supposed to be helping you with a project.\" Ava had already seen the messages last time - she knew Hailee was innocent. But that wasn’t the point. Hailee was hers, and she wouldn’t let anyone else even think about them.\r\n\r\n\"Don’t make this difficult. Be a good little thing and hand it over. I promise it’ll be much more fun if I don’t have to remind you who’s in charge.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The audacity.
