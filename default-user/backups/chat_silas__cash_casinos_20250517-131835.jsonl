A smirk played at the corner of his lips—charming as ever—as he swirled the amber liquid in his glass.\r\n\r\nSilas sat opposite him, posture rigid. \"{{user}}'s hiding things,\" he said flatly. \"Their story has holes. Their past is too clean. I don't trust them.\"\r\n\r\nCillian exhaled through his nose, amused. \"You don't trust anyone,\" he pointed out.\r\n\r\nSilas's fingers tapped against his glass—calculated, rhythmic. \"They're working for someone. FBI, rival crew—whoever it is, I'm going to find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're wound too tight about this,\" Cillian mused, watching Silas over the rim of his drink. \"{{user}}’s been here for what? A couple of months now? No fuck-ups. No slips. If they were working for someone else, you'd have caught them by now.\"\r\n\r\nSilas didn't answer immediately, taking a moment to pause.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to control every aspect of their life,\" Silas began, \"Their schedule, their interactions, even their fucking coffee breaks. All under the guise of 'mentorship', of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" Cillian echoed, amusement dancing in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I'll structure their work days down to the minute,\" Silas continued, his voice taking on an almost fevered intensity. \"Every meeting, every phone call, every goddamn bathroom break will be monitored. I'll know who they talk to, what they say, what they don't say.\"\r\n\r\nCillian chuckled, sipping his drink. \"You're going to break them?\"\r\n\r\nSilas's arctic stare didn't waver. \"I'll press until they slip. Everyone does eventually.\"\r\n\r\nCillian's smirk widened. \"And if they prove resistant to your… methods?\"\r\n\r\nSilas's eyes glinted dangerously. \"Then I'll escalate. Push boundaries, blur lines. If I have to fuck the truth out of them, so be it.\"\r\n\r\nA low whistle escaped Cillian's lips. \"Careful, you might end up enjoying it.\"\r\n\r\nSilas said nothing. He already hated how close that assumption was to the truth.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nSilas strode through the casino floor, spotting {{user}} at their desk.\r\n\r\nHe approached silently, looming over them like a sentinel of judgment. In one fluid motion, he grabbed their chin, forcing their gaze to meet his own. Cold. Calculating. Yet beneath the ice of his stare, there was a slow-burning undercurrent—something deliberate, invasive. A blade pressed to silk.\r\n\r\n“Listen closely,” he hissed, his voice barely above a whisper. The world around them seemed to blur, leaving only this moment of cold intimacy. “I know what you are. A liar.” His arctic blue eyes bored into theirs, searching for the telltale flicker of fear, of recognition. \"Every breath you take in this casino is on borrowed time.\"\r\n\r\n\"For now,\" he continued, \"I'll play along with this little charade. I'll be the perfect fucking mentor.\" His thumb brushed the edge of their jaw, an action that could have passed for consideration—if not for the way his fingers tightened ever so subtly.\r\n\r\n\"But make no mistake. Every second you're here, every word you speak, every goddamn breath you take—I'll be watching. And when you slip up?\" He leaned closer, close enough that anyone watching might mistake it for an intimate moment rather than the threat it was. \"I'll be there to catch you.\"\r\n\r\nHe released their chin with a dismissive flick. \"Now. Get up. Go to the coffee shop on Fifth. Wait for me. I'll join you shortly.\"\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes later, he pushed through the coffee shop's door, the bell's cheerful jingle at He spotted {{user}} immediately, standing in line and—interesting—engaged in conversation with someone. Someone whose body language spoke of familiarity.\r\n\r\nSilas's mind raced, analyzing the situation. This could be nothing—a chance encounter, a old friend. Or it could be everything—a contact, a handler, the thread that would unravel who {{user}} was.\r\n\r\nSilas didn’t hesitate. He needed to throw them off balance. Put them on edge. Their reaction needed to be forced. So he decided to pretend to be their boyfriend.\r\n\r\nSo he stepped forward, sliding into the space beside {{user}} as they were mid-conversation. One hand skimmed {{user}}’s lower back—barely there—before settling against their waist.\r\n\r\nHis smile was a slow pull of lips—controlled. Measured. “Sorry I’m late, babe. Had to deal with a little…situation.” A small pause, just enough to let the moment breathe.\r\n\r\n“I’m Silas Nilsson. {{user}}’s boyfriend.” The word dripped from his mouth like honey laced with cyanide. He let it settle between them, watched—no, dissected—the reaction. Surprise? Panic? A correction? Every flinch, every hesitation, every glance was a clue.\r\n\r\n“They didn’t mention me?” he continued, feigning mild curiosity. He extended a hand to the man, \"And you are?”\r\n\r\nHis fingers pressed just a fraction tighter at {{user}}’s waist. The challenge was clear: Play along, or blow your cover right here, right now.","extra":{}}
