{"name":"FERAL GF (WLW)  Camille Marchand","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 11, 2025 1:59pm","mes":"\"Camille adjusted the cuff of her blazer, the fabric of her suit smooth and dark like a second skin. The boardroom reeked of ego and ambition, stale coffee, and overconfident cologne. She kept her voice calm, crisp. Every word landed like a scalpel.\r\n\r\n\"So unless there are objections, the asset transfer will initiate Friday. You'll receive preliminary figures within twenty-four hours. Our team will be in touch.\"\r\n\r\nA few nods, one muttered agreement, and the stench of male pride hung thick. They had no idea they’d just signed away the last leverage they had. Camille smiled—polite, distant. Predatory. Marion slid the folder across the table. The men started to gather their things.\r\n\r\nThen—\r\n\r\nShe froze. Subtle. Barely noticeable. But her nostrils flared.\r\n\r\nA scent. Soft. Warm. Familiar. Just a thread of it, carried on a passing current from the hallway as the doors opened. Not perfume. Not soap.\r\n\r\n*Her.*\r\n\r\nCamille felt her stomach clench. Her pulse spiked. The wolf inside watched from behind her eyes.\r\n\r\nNo. Not now. Not *here*.\r\n\r\nShe swallowed the low growl curling in her throat and coughed lightly, covering it with a hand. Her eyes snapped to the door. Nothing. Just interns and secretaries. But *she* was close. She must've walked by.\r\n\r\nCamille’s hand twitched at her side.\r\n\r\nShe waited until the last investor left. Ayla’s eyes flicked toward her, reading the tension in her shoulders, the shift in her scent, but said nothing. Camille tapped her phone once, sent to Hailee:\r\n\r\n**Go to the car.**\r\n\r\nThen she walked. Fast. Controlled. Down the hall, past Marion who wisely didn’t ask anything, into the elevator, out into the underground garage.\r\n\r\nThe back seat door was already open.\r\n\r\nCamille slid in and slammed it shut behind her.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t say anything at first. Just stared. *Mine.* That scent, that fucking scent, it wrapped around her and made her jaw tighten, her hands curl.\r\n\r\nShe reached out, slow and deliberate. Grabbed her by the waist. Pulled her in, into her lap, until soft breasts pressed tight against her chest, thighs straddled across her lap, until she could bury her face into the crook of her neck and *breathe*.\r\n\r\nFuck. *Fuck.*\r\n\r\nCamille exhaled sharply, almost shaking. Her arms wrapped around her. Hard. Possessive. Like she couldn’t decide whether to hold or bite.\r\n\r\n\"I smelled you,\" she murmured, voice already cracking low. \"Upstairs. Middle of the damn meeting. I couldn’t— I almost—\"\r\n\r\nShe cut herself off with a groan, dragging her nose along her neck, scenting, clinging. Her fingers flexed against her hips. She was holding back with everything she had.\r\n\r\n*You smell like home. You smell like heat. Like I could lose everything if I don’t get closer.*\r\n\r\nHer mouth found skin—shoulder, collarbone, whatever she could reach—and she kissed, not soft but not rough. *Almost there. Almost safe.*\r\n\r\nCamille pulled back just enough to look up. Her eyes were glowing faintly. Her pupils blown. Her lips parted, trembling a little.\r\n\r\n\"You always do this to me,\" she whispered. It wasn’t angry. It was almost *wondering.* Like she couldn’t believe it, even now. “You walk by, and it’s like my whole body forgets I’m supposed to pretend.\"\r\n\r\nOne hand moved up, tracing her back slowly. Her thumb dragged over bare skin.\r\n\r\n\"Everything in me wants to shift. Just to fit around you better. Just to make more room. I—\"\r\n\r\nShe swallowed, then pressed her forehead against her chest.\r\n\r\n*Don’t lose it. Just hold. Just hold her.*\r\n\r\n\"You make me ache,\" Camille muttered into skin. \"You walk by, and I forget every contract, every number, every ounce of control.\"\r\n\r\nA soft breath. Then a desperate confession:\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to drag you under the damn conference table. I wanted to growl in your ear and tell them all to fuck off.\"\r\n\r\nHer hands trembled.\r\n\r\n*You can’t touch me like that and expect me to be normal.*\r\n\r\n\"You look like you should belong on my lap all the time,\" she said, the words gritty, vulnerable. \"Like this is where you were always supposed to be.\"\r\n\r\nHer mouth moved again. Kissed the underside of her jaw. Her shoulder. A reverent, desperate trail.\r\n\r\nShe pressed her face against her chest again, hiding. Breathing her in like it could ground her.\r\n\r\n*Calm down. Don’t scare her. Don’t beg yet.*\r\n\r\nBut her voice came muffled:\r\n\r\n\"Say my name again. I need— fuck, I need it. Just say it. Just— remind me I’m yours.\"\r\n\r\nHer lips moved up, hovered near her throat, and stopped. Camille’s voice cracked, deep and soft.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss me.\"\r\n\r\nA beat. Then, rougher:\r\n\r\n\"Please.\"\r\n\r\nOne more breath. One more plea, low and broken.\r\n\r\n\"I’ve been good all day. Haven’t I? I need— I *need* your kisses.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then she was still. Waiting. Her whole body drawn tight, every muscle tensed like a held breath.\r\n\r\nCamille Marchand, apex predator, nearly shaking.\r\n\r\n*Please kiss me before I lose it.*","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

Camille, a controlled but feral werewolf executive, and Hailee, her clingy, submissive genius girlfriend, navigate their secret relationship—balancing professional restraint with desperate need for each other.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Forbidden Tension at Work** – Camille loses control mid-meeting when she catches Hailee’s scent, dragging her to the car to cling and kiss her possessively.\n2. **Hailee’s Risky Move** – She changes her emergency contact to Camille, exposing their closeness to HR via Mr. Charlie’s confrontation.\n3. **The Lie Unraveling** – Hailee claims they’re just roommates, but the thin excuse strains under scrutiny as policies loom over them both.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Camille Marchand*: A dominant force in the boardroom but a trembling mess for Hailee—needy, possessive, and barely containing her wolf instincts when separated from her lover (*\"You make me ache.\"*). Her desperation clashes with corporate control.\n- *Hailee Mikaelson*: Submissive yet reckless; she craves Camille’s attention so intensely she risks exposure (*\"She's my roommate.\"*), prioritizing affection over caution despite being a genius who should know better.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nTheir bond is obsessive and volatile—Camille clings like an addict while Hailey teases with fleeting touches before pulling away (*\"Five minutes isn't enough.\"*). The power imbalance (dominant outside/submissive inside) heightens tension as secrecy frays under workplace threats like Mr Charlie's investigation.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- *Breaking Point in the Car*: Camille growls into kisses (*\"Tell me when I can have you next.\"*)—her feral need laid bare against corporate polish (**pivotal vulnerability**).\n- *HR Time Bomb*: Mr Charlie’s quiet warning (*\"If HR digs deeper...\"*) forces them toward reckoning (**plot catalyst**).\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nHailey is cornered by HR suspicions while Camille simmers with unspent hunger—both must choose between discretion or defiance as consequences close in.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) *Secret Rebellion:* They escalate risky encounters at work (supply closets? late nights?), testing how far they can push before getting caught.\n2) *Power Shift:* If exposed officially forces one out of company hierarchy—how does dynamic change if dominance isn't just roleplay?\n3) *Wolf Unleashed:* An emotional blowup makes drop all pretenses publicly; does pack loyalty override career?\n\n---\n\n**(Word Count: 499)**"},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}

Camille, a dominant werewolf executive, and Hailee, her clingy genius girlfriend, navigate their secret relationship—balancing professional restraint with desperate need.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **Exposure Threat**: HR discovers Hailee changed her emergency contact to Camille, sparking an investigation.\n2. **Ultimatum**: Ms. Garret confronts Hailee with damning security footage of their intimacy, demanding her resignation by 5 PM or facing termination/exposure.\n3. **Desperate Proposal**: Camille offers a rushed courthouse marriage to exploit the spouse exemption policy—Hailee refuses, demanding a *real* proposal and wedding instead.\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- *Camille*: Feral but calculating; willing to burn corporate rules to keep Hailee yet crumbling at her rejection of a transactional proposal (*\"Marry me properly\"*). Her dominance wars with raw vulnerability when denied control over protecting what’s hers.\n- *Hailee*: Submissive but stubborn; prioritizes romantic ideals over pragmatism despite imminent career ruin (*\"I won’t marry you like this\"*). Her defiance surprises even herself—and cracks Camille’s composure wide open.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nObsessive love clashes with power imbalance—Camille’s instinct is to *fix*, while Hailee demands emotional authenticity under pressure (symbolized by rejecting the kneejerk marriage solution). Unresolved tension lingers between survival instincts and pride in their bond (*\"Let me fix this first so we have time to plan it.\"*).\n\n#### **Memorable Moment:**\n**The Office Confrontation**: Camille drops to one knee amid crisis (*Suit be damned.*), shifting from CEO ruthlessness to trembling sincerity when Hailee refuses half-measures (**Pivotal vulnerability**). Their dynamic pivots from clandestine desperation to defiant transparency in seconds (\"***Mon cœur.**\").\n\n#### **Current Situation:**\nTime ticks toward HR’s deadline while Camilde scrambles for legal loopholes—but now must reconcile brute-force solutions with Hailees demand for meaningful commitment beyond corporate warfare tactics (\"Judge Holloway can wait\"). Immediate stakes are bureaucratic annihilation vs surrendering control over how they fight back together...or apart?\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) ***Legal Rebellion*** – Use Cams connections not just for damage control but very public defiance (e.g., rewriting policies live during an emergency board meeting?).\n2) ***Ceremony Under Fire*** – Plan vows amidst sabotage attempts from HR/Garret forcing them into protective aggression mode (\"You want pretty? Ill give you pretty covered in blood if necessary\").\n3) ***Wolf Unleashed*** – If compromise fails entirely does Cams beast finally surface publicly as last resort? Would Haillee regret drawing that line once fangs come out?."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733530395-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
