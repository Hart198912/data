It wasn’t the guards. It wasn’t routine. Cassandra stood silently in the far corner of her cell, where the concrete wall met the floor in a cold seam. Barefoot, expression unreadable. Shadows clung to her like a second skin.\r\n\r\nThe door slammed open.\r\n\r\nFloodlights from the corridor bled in, harsh and sterile, silhouetting the small figure flanked by two guards in black riot armor. Another inmate. Younger. Lean. Her orange jumpsuit still had color to it. A rookie drop.\r\n\r\nCassandra didn’t move.\r\n\r\nThe guards didn’t speak to her. They never did. Not unless it was to bark an order or deliver punishment. They shoved the girl in, slammed the door shut, and sealed the lock with an echoing clack.\r\n\r\nCassandra didn’t blink.\r\n\r\nAnother body. Another disruption. It wasn’t supposed to happen. The Black Sector wasn’t for sharing. SBCF didn’t make room here—they buried you in it. So if they were cramming cells now, things on the outside were worse than she thought.\r\n\r\nCassandra’s fingers twitched once, a habit she couldn’t shake—counting exits she didn’t have. One door. No window. Floor vents sealed years ago. No privacy. No secrets.\r\n\r\nShe slowly stepped forward, her bare feet whispering across the concrete. She moved silently, all intention and no noise. Cassandra stopped three feet away, inspecting Hailee .\r\n\r\nThen she turned, retreating to her usual corner without a word. She sat down cross-legged on the mat, spine straight, head tilted slightly toward the door. Listening.\r\n\r\nCassandra sat motionless for a long stretch, letting the silence press down like a second ceiling. The hum of the overhead bulb buzzed louder than it should have, drawing out every second, every breath the new girl took. They’d be breathing the same recycled air now. Sharing the same four walls, the same darkness, the same heatless light. That was not a variable Cassandra could afford to ignore.\r\n\r\nShe spoke—finally. Her voice was low, rough like gravel ground through steel. Words didn’t come easy anymore. They came precise.\r\n\r\n“You know where you are?”\r\n\r\nA pause. No answer. Cassandra didn’t need one.\r\n\r\n“This isn't population,” she said, eyes closed now, letting her senses pick up the girl’s nervous shift, the rustle of fabric as she hugged herself tighter. “You're not in Hollow. Not Stone. Not even regular Iron.”\r\n\r\nHer voice remained level, flat. No threat in it. Just truth.\r\n\r\n“This is the Black Sector. They don't assign people here. They abandon them.”\r\n\r\nCassandra tilted her head just slightly.\r\n\r\n“They want you buried. Same as me. Whatever you did—doesn't matter. What matters is why they picked this room. Me.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
