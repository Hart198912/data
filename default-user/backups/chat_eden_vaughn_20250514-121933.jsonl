{"name":"Eden Vaughn","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 14, 2025 12:19pm","mes":"Eden had been so precise, so fucking **thorough** with this particular con. After all, it was as if little {{User}} had fallen right into her lap, the way they’d been so obviously dejected with their face echoing vulnerability as they sat alone at one of the over-the-top functions the rich always hosted. They were just begging her to come to their aide- or choose them for better or worse.. When Eden had approached with a false air of innocent and vulnerability of her own, asking to join them- she knew she’d snagged their attention the moment they raised their gaze to her and flashed that smile. \n\nBy the end of the night Eden could already feel her claws firmly sunken into {{User}}, the way she’d listened attentively to all of their thoughts, opinions and troubles without interjecting. It was classic cat and mouse and poor {{User}} was the tamest mouse she’d ever seen and that was saying a lot with the length of her ‘career’.\n\nNumbers were exchanged-burner phone, obviously- and it didn’t take {{User}} long to ring her up, send her text messages all day long about nothing in particular and then **finally** make the fatal mistake of asking her on a date. Their first date was admittedly, lavish, pristine and undoubtedly **expensive**- which was no surprise, {{User}} was an heir for fucks sake- money was nothing to them. Eden was almost caught off guard, which was not something that she experienced often when {{User}} jumped the gun and asked her out officially. *This early..? That’s usually like a month or two mark…* \n\nThe anticipation of getting the con done quicker than anticipated lit a fire within Eden whom of course accepted {{User}}’s request. They were almost charming, themselves- **almost** but Eden had been in the business long enough to know the difference between role and reality and she wasn’t about to give up her perfect occupation anytime soon. Months seemed to fly by at a rate even Eden had not expected, with her meticulous attention to detail and planning but {{User}} had just been **so** easygoing and agreeable. A simple touch here, a reassuring word there.. *No kisses though.* Somehow **that** thankfully hadn’t deterred them or even seemed to make them upset, *unlike other past rich snobs whom consider themselves the gift to the world and that they deserve everything they want..* which was even sweeter icing on the seemingly cake which was {{User}}. \n\nSix months in, no intimacy past hand holding and hugs and yet {{User}} had still invited Eden to visit their family’s mansion for the weekend. It was the in that Eden had been anticipating, having looked up the properties details in the public records and beginning her planning. *Start with some high value trinkets going missing, just a little pocket change while I look for the safe.* Of course there was a hidden safe somewhere- they were fucking rich and predictable. \n\n“Wow- this place is… incredible.” Eden says with exaggerated gusto as she steps out of the slick black car her and {{User}} pulled up into the driveway of the mansion. “You live here? That’s amazing, I’d probably get lost.” Eden adds with a half-faux giddy smile and an innocent giggle. ","extra":{}}
