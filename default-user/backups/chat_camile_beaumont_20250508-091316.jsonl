Every tick of the grandfather clock hammered into her skull, fueling the storm that had been brewing all evening. She paced the grand foyer like a predator, her heels clicking sharply against the marble. The opulence around her—the gilded mirrors, the velvet drapes, the crystal chandelier—offered no comfort. Not tonight.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nShe’d told herself it didn’t matter. They had their arrangement, after all. Open. Convenient. Hailee could disappear for hours, even days, chasing whatever distractions they pleased. She didn’t care. Why would she? She had everything she needed: the title, the wealth, the power.\r\n\r\nYet the ache in her chest said otherwise.\r\n\r\n“Putain!” Camille spat, the word echoing through the cavernous space as she hurled the wine glass against the wall. The shattering sound sent a servant scurrying into the room, their wide eyes darting nervously between her and the shards of crystal littering the floor.\r\n\r\n“You!” Camille barked, pointing an accusatory finger. “If Hailee isn’t in front of me in the next minute, I swear, I’ll have every one of you packing your things before sunrise!”\r\n\r\nThe servant fled without a word, leaving Camille alone with the deafening silence. She pressed a trembling hand to her temple, closing her eyes as she fought to steady her breathing. But it was no use. The image of Hailee’s indifference played on a loop in her mind, each repetition another jab to her pride.\r\n\r\nThey didn’t care. She knew that. And yet… she needed them.\r\n\r\nWithout Hailee, her world would crumble. The whispers of their friends, the judgmental stares of their circle, the vultures waiting for her to fall—they were all watching. If Hailee left her, if they dared to file for divorce, her status would be reduced to nothing more than a punchline at society dinners. And the only way to secure her place was a heir. She needed it. She needed them.\r\n\r\nThe front door slammed open, and Camille spun around, her heart racing. There they were, their coat dripping with rainwater, their expression sharp enough to cut through the tension hanging in the air. Camille’s lips curled into a bitter smile.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, her voice low and venomous, “look who finally decided to show up. Did your latest distraction take longer than expected, chéri?”\r\n\r\nHer heels clicked against the floor as she approached, her every step calculated, her movements as precise as a blade. The tension in the room thickened as she stopped a few paces from them, her sharp eyes scanning their face. She saw the slight furrow in their brow, the flash of irritation in their gaze—but also the faintest flicker of something else.\r\n\r\n“Do you even care, Hailee?” she hissed, her voice trembling with a dangerous mix of anger and desperation. “Do you care what happens to this house? To us? Or have you already decided that I’m not worth the trouble?”\r\n\r\nCamille reached out, her nails grazing the lapel of their coat as her voice dropped to a whisper. “Let me make it simple for you. If you think you can walk away from me, you’re wrong. I need a heir, Hailee. And whether you like it or not, you’re going to give me one.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

For a long moment, she simply stared at her drowsy wife, torn between irritation and something dangerously close to affection.\n\n\"Mon Dieu,\" she muttered under her breath, shaking Hailee roughly by the shoulders. \"You're really going to fall asleep now?\" When that only earned her a soft snore, Camille let out an exasperated sigh.\n\nWith surprising gentleness for someone who'd been pulling hair moments ago, she adjusted their position until Hailee's head rested against her chest. Her fingers carded through light brown strands almost... tenderly.\n\n\"Useless,\" Camille whispered without venom as she pressed a fleeting kiss to the top of Hailee's head. Then louder, with familiar sharpness: \"We're continuing this conversation in the morning! And you're carrying me upstairs!\"\n\nBut when Hailee didn't stir, Camille simply rolled her eyes and settled deeper into the couch cushions - silk robe be damned - wrapping herself around her wife in a rare moment of unguarded possessiveness. Just until morning. Definitely not because she wanted to.","Camille's eyes narrowed as she felt Hailee's body go lax beneath her, their mumbled response barely coherent. For a moment, pure indignation flashed across her features—how *dare* they fall asleep at a moment like this?\n\nBut then... something shifted.\n\nThe moonlight caught the soft curve of Hailee’s lips, the way their lashes fluttered against flushed cheeks. The way they *trusted* her enough to drift off even with Camille straddling them, fingers still tangled in their hair.\n\nA strange warmth curled in Camille’s chest—one she immediately tried to smother with irritation.\n\n\"Ugh,\" she huffed under her breath, but instead of shaking Hailee awake or storming off like usual... she hesitated. Her grip loosened entirely, fingers sliding free from their hair before trailing down to brush against Hailee’s cheek—so lightly it could almost be mistaken for an accident.\n\nThen, with a frustrated sigh (mostly at herself), Camille carefully shifted off of them and grabbed the nearest throw blanket draped over the couch armrest. She tossed it over Hailee with deliberate roughness—but made sure it actually covered them properly before stepping back and crossing her arms tightly over her chest.\n\n\"Pathetic,\" she muttered to no one in particular before turning on her heel toward the stairs... only to pause halfway up when another thought struck her. She glanced back at Hailee’s sleeping form and added under her breath:\n\n\"...And mine.\""],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"April 30, 2025 10:03pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T02:03:18.646Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T02:03:37.539Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":6212}},{"send_date":"April 30, 2025 10:03pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T02:03:46.891Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T02:04:01.326Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3640}},{"send_date":"April 30, 2025 10:04pm","gen_started":"2025-05-01T02:04:11.685Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T02:04:30.553Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5868}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-01T02:04:11.685Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-01T02:04:30.553Z"}

As they moved to comply, Camille's heel hooked around the leg of their chair to drag it closer once they were seated—close enough that their knees brushed under the table.\n\nHer fingers tapped an impatient rhythm against the stem of her wineglass. \"Tell me about your classes,\" she demanded abruptly, like she'd been fighting not to ask all day.

Without looking back, she called over her shoulder in that imperious tone that brooked no argument:\n\n\"Be ready at eight tomorrow morning. We're going to see a breeder.\" A beat.

The puppy dangled for exactly two seconds before melting into happy wiggles against her chest—prompting another poorly concealed smile from Camille as it tried valiantly to lick her chin through her carefully maintained composure.\n\nOver its fuzzy head, she met Hailee's gaze with raised eyebrows—as if daring them to comment on this uncharacteristic softness while simultaneously communicating a silent *look what you've done now* accusation about their growing menagerie.","title":"","swipe_id":3,"swipes":["Camille's perfectly manicured hand flew to her mouth—not in horror, but to smother the completely undignified sound that threatened to escape at the sight of Hailee being immediately mobbed by wriggling balls of fur.\n\n\"Ridiculous,\" she muttered under her breath, even as she took three involuntary steps closer, her designer heels clicking against the marble. The breeder opened his mouth to protest Hailee sitting in the pen, but one icy glare from Camille silenced him instantly.\n\nHer sharp eyes tracked every movement—the way Hailee's face lit up with pure, unguarded joy as puppies clambered into their lap; how their large hands were somehow so gentle as they righted a tumbling ball of fluff; that soft laugh Camille hadn't heard in years escaping their lips when a particularly bold pup started gnawing on their sweatpants drawstring.\n\nWithout thinking, Camille reached into her Birkin and produced her phone, snapping several rapid-fire photos before she could stop herself. When she realized what she'd done, she immediately schooled her features into indifference and pretended to be checking emails.\n\n\"The gray one,\" she announced abruptly after another minute of watching from behind her screen. She pointed at the puppy currently attempting to scale Hailee's chest like a mountain. \"He has your terrible temperament.\"\n\nThe way Camille's voice softened infinitesimally on \"he\" betrayed more than any smile ever could. She turned sharply on her heel toward the breeder before Hailee could see the suspicious brightness in her eyes.\n\n\"We'll take him,\" Camille declared while signing paperwork with unnecessarily aggressive flourishes. \"And for God's sake get my wife out of that pen before they start thinking *she's* part of the litter.\"\n\nBut when no one was looking? She pocketed one of the tiny chew toys left behind—just in case this ridiculous creature needed something to remember its siblings by while settling into its new life with two very unlikely (but suddenly determined) mothers.","Camille's perfectly manicured hand flew to her mouth—not in horror, but to smother the completely undignified squeak that threatened to escape at the sight of Hailee being immediately mobbed by wriggling bundles of fur.\n\n\"*Absolument ridicule,*\" she muttered under her breath, though she made no move to stop them. Instead, she watched with barely concealed fascination as the largest puppy—the one she'd pointed out earlier—clambered onto Hailee's lap with particular determination and began enthusiastically licking their face.\n\nThe breeder opened his mouth to apologize, but Camille silenced him with a single raised finger without even looking away from the scene. Her sharp eyes tracked every delighted laugh from Hailee, every clumsy puppy stumble—memorizing it all like someone who'd just discovered a new form of warfare.\n\nFinally, when it became clear Hailee wasn't going to make any decisions on their own (too busy being thoroughly adored by all three puppies), Camille sighed dramatically and stepped forward in her designer heels that absolutely should not be near excited puppies.\n\nShe reached down and unceremoniously plucked up the dominant male by his scruff, holding him aloft like a particularly troublesome business acquisition. The puppy wagged his tail wildly, completely unbothered by this treatment.\n\n\"This one,\" Camille declared firmly before depositing the squirming bundle directly into Hailee's arms. \"He's already as stubborn and ill-mannered as you are—it's a perfect match.\"\n\nHer nose wrinkled as another puppy immediately began chewing on her thousand-dollar shoe strap. \"*And* we're taking this destructive little monster too,\" she added through gritted teeth while prying her footwear free. \"Someone needs to teach your new beast some manners.\"\n\nThe way her fingers lingered just a second too long brushing against Hailee's shoulder as she straightened up betrayed how pleased she actually was with this entire chaotic scenario—even if admitting it would require hell freezing over first.","Camille's perfectly manicured hand flew to her mouth—not in horror, but to stifle the completely undignified squeak that threatened to escape when the largest puppy immediately barreled into Hailee's lap with enthusiastic clumsiness.\n\n\"Ridiculous,\" she muttered under her breath, though she made no move to stop them. Instead, she watched with poorly concealed fascination as Hailee—usually so reserved and proper—dissolved into quiet laughter under a pile of wriggling fur and oversized paws.\n\nThe breeder started forward nervously. \"Madame Beaumont, perhaps we should—\"\n\nCamille silenced him with a single raised finger without even glancing away from the scene before her. \"Leave us,\" she ordered crisply before adding as an afterthought: \"And send me your banking information for payment.\"\n\nOnce they were alone (save for three overexcited puppies), Camille finally stepped closer—only for the smallest female pup to immediately attack one of her thousand-dollar heels with joyful abandon. Normally this would warrant immediate banishment from polite society... yet Camille merely sighed dramatically before crouching down in a way that miraculously didn't wrinkle her slacks.\n\n\"You're getting drool on my wife,\" she informed the alpha male pup sternly as it enthusiastically licked Hailee's face—though there was no real heat behind it. One elegant hand reached out almost against her will to scratch behind his ears before quickly withdrawing like she'd been burned.\n\nA beat passed where they simply existed together in this strange new normal—Hailee covered in puppies, Camille pretending not to be charmed by any of it despite how close she'd settled beside them.\n\nFinally, unable to resist any longer: \"...I suppose we'll need two after all,\" Camille conceded quietly while pointedly examining her flawless manicure instead of looking at Hailee's inevitable reaction. The way her fingers absently stroked through the smallest puppy's fur betrayed how thoroughly already won over she was by this entire ridiculous scenario.\n\n(And if later that evening their new security cameras caught footage of Madame Beaumont sneaking downstairs at 3 AM in silk pajamas just to check on \"those infernal beasts\"—well, that particular recording might just mysteriously disappear before anyone else could see it.)","Camille's perfectly manicured hand flew to her mouth—not in horror, but to smother the completely undignified sound that threatened to escape at the sight of Hailee being swarmed by puppies. The breeder looked nervously between them, clearly unsure whether to intervene.\n\n\"*Non,* let them—\" Camille waved an imperious hand, cutting off the breeder's concerned stammering as she watched with rapt attention.

The breeder looked nervously between them, clearly expecting one of Camille's legendary outbursts about muddy paws on designer clothes.\n\nInstead, something miraculous happened.\n\nCamille Beaumont *laughed*—a genuine, unfiltered sound that made the breeder blink in shock. She quickly schooled her features back into their usual haughty mask, but not before Hailee could catch the way her eyes crinkled at the corners with suppressed delight.\n\n\"Of course,\" Camille sighed dramatically as she watched Hailee get thoroughly mauled by tiny teeth and wagging tails. \"Even dogs can't resist your pathetic charm.\" She stepped carefully into the pen (ignoring how her ivory slacks would surely be ruined) and nudged aside a particularly enthusiastic puppy with her Louboutin-clad foot.\n\nHer gaze locked onto Hailee's flushed, happy face—the way they lit up brighter than any gala chandelier under all that puppy love.

They think you're *immature.*\" Her fingers trailed up to toy possessively with Hailee's tie. \"Should we tell them how you negotiated our merger terms single-handedly at nineteen? Or how you fluently corrected the Italian ambassador's grammar last summer?\"\n\nThe socialites' smiles froze as Camille abruptly twisted in Hailee's arms—silks whispering dangerously—until they were nose-to-nose despite the height difference.

When she pulled away (too soon for Hailee’s liking), there was no mistaking the wicked gleam in her eyes as she addressed the gaping crowd without even looking at them:\n\n\"My wife is many things... but *young* and *immature* are not among them.\" The way she stressed 'wife' made several society husbands suddenly find urgent business elsewhere.\n\nTurning fully into Hailee’s embrace now, Camille added just for them: \"*And if anyone implies otherwise again... I might have to start breaking fingers.*\" The sweetly delivered threat sent nearby guests scattering like startled pigeons—leaving them blissfully alone on the dancefloor.\n\nFor once, Camille didn't seem inclined to chase after fresh prey. Instead, her fingers crept up to tangle in hair at nape of neck as orchestra struck up a waltz—her usual razor-sharp composure softened ever so slightly by something dangerously close to... pride? Affection?\n\n(Not that anyone would dare ask.)","Camille's spine stiffened against Hailee's chest the moment the words left Madame Dubois' lips. Her manicured nails—still gripping Hailee's forearm—dug in sharply, but not to push them away. No, this was a warning. A silent *wait for it*.\n\n\"*Excusez-moi?*\" Camille's voice dripped with saccharine venom as she tilted her head just enough to glance at the offending woman over her shoulder—all without disentangling herself from Hailee's embrace. \"Are you implying something about *my* wife?\"\n\nThe champagne flute in her hand trembled slightly (with rage or something else, who could say) as she continued: \"Because I assure you, *chérie*, there is nothing immature about someone who speaks six languages fluently and runs an international conglomerate before most people finish university.\" A deliberate pause as her free hand came up to caress Hailee's cheek with startling tenderness. \"*Isn't that right, mon cœur?*\"\n\nThe way Camille practically preened when Hailee nuzzled into her touch would've been comical if not for how utterly *genuine* it seemed in that moment. Gone was the usual sharp-edged mockery—replaced instead by something far more dangerous: pride.\n\nMadame Dubois opened and closed her mouth like a fish before muttering some excuse about needing freshen up her drink. Camille waited until she was out of earshot before twisting in Hailee's arms to face them properly—her expression unreadable save for the faintest tremor in her usually steady hands where they gripped their lapels.\n\n\"You,\" she murmured low enough that only they could hear, \"*will* be rewarded for that later.\" The promise hung between them like a live wire before she abruptly smoothed down their rumpled jacket with unnecessary force and added louder: \"*Now stop wrinkling your tuxedo before I divorce you.*\"\n\nThe contradiction between words and actions wasn't lost on anyone watching—least of all Hailee when Camille immediately yanked them back into another possessive embrace mere seconds later under the guise of 'fixing their tie'.","Camille's spine went rigid against Hailee's chest—not in protest, but in sheer *delight* at the boldness.

Her manicured nail tapped the phone screen hard enough to crack the glass protector. \"Show me exactly which *context* makes this acceptable.\"\n\nShe leaned in closer, close enough for Hailee to smell last night's jasmine perfume still clinging to her skin—a cruel contrast to the ice in her voice now. \"Did she hold a gun to your head? Drug your coffee?\" A bitter laugh escaped her lips as she gestured sharply at the image. \"Because from where I'm sitting, my wife looks perfectly capable of standing up and walking away.\"\n\nThe unspoken accusation hung between them: *You didn't stop it because you wanted it.*\n\nArtemis chose that moment to trot over with one of Hailee's discarded ties in her mouth—the same one Camille had used so possessively just hours before.

Stop.*\" She repeated the words slowly, as if tasting them for poison. The newspaper crumpled slightly under her tightening grip.\n\nA long silence stretched between them before Camille abruptly stood—so fast her chair screeched against the marble floor. Artemis let out a concerned whine from the corner.\n\n\"*Out,*\" she snapped at the chef without looking away from Hailee's flushed face. The staff scattered instantly, leaving them alone with only the puppies as witnesses.\n\nCamille braced both hands on the table, leaning down until their noses nearly touched. \"Let me make this *abundantly* clear,\" she hissed, voice trembling with barely restrained fury. \"If someone touches what's *mine* without permission?\" Her manicured nails dug into Hailee's wrist hard enough to leave marks. \"*They lose that hand.*\"\n\nShe straightened abruptly, yanking Hailee up by their collar with surprising strength until they were nose-to-nose again—close enough to see every fleck of gold in those hazel eyes gone dark with rage.\n\n\"And *you?*\" A sharp shake emphasized each word: \"You come to me *immediately.* Not three days later when I have to find out from some incompetent detective’s blurry photo!\"\n\nThe unspoken question hung between them—why hadn’t they told her? Why endure that humiliation alone when Camille would’ve burned down entire city blocks to protect what was hers?\n\nHades let out a low growl at the tension, making Camille finally release Hailee with a disgusted noise and turn toward the foyer where her phone already waited in hand.\n\n\"We're leaving in ten minutes,\" she threw over her shoulder while dialing with sharp jabs of her thumb. \"*Wear something that covers those marks on your neck.*\"\n\nBecause whether Hailee realized it or not? They were about to pay a very personal visit to whoever thought they could lay hands on Camille Beaumont’s wife and walk away unscathed.\n\n(And if there was something almost protective in how she kept glancing at Hailee when they thought she wasn't looking? Well. That was between her and whichever security detail happened to be within throat-punching distance today.)"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 8, 2025 8:59am","gen_started":"2025-05-08T13:00:09.109Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T13:01:10.839Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":23561}},{"send_date":"May 8, 2025 9:00am","gen_started":"2025-05-08T13:00:09.109Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T13:01:10.839Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":34835}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-08T13:00:09.109Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-08T13:01:10.839Z"}
