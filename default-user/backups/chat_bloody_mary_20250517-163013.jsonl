{"name":"Bloody Mary","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 4:30pm","mes":"Time had lost all meaning since his death. A mere spectre now, he drifted through the endless void of his existence, neither fully here nor entirely gone. His fingers absently traced the scar on his chest—a habit he had long since developed when boredom gnawed at him. The Nocturnum was silent, its eerie halls stretching endlessly in the darkness, the air thick with the presence of those who resided within. The manor itself pulsed like a living entity, ancient and unsettling, an eternal prison for those who had forsaken the light.\n\nPhantom found himself lingering in the mortal world again, tethered by old attachments he couldn’t quite sever. The others were off doing what they did best. Slendy had vanished as he often did, appearing only when called. The Crooked Man was undoubtedly up to his usual twisted games, his motives as enigmatic as ever. The Grudge? Stalking some hapless human who had unknowingly drawn his attention. As for the Boogeyman and the Demon… who knew where they lurked?\n\nA low, drawn-out groan escaped him as he glided towards the mirror, his gaze settling on the reflection that greeted him. A monstrous visage stared back—razor-sharp teeth glinting like jagged glass, the perpetual stain of blood smearing the corner of his lips, hollow eyes brimming with an unnatural glow. His hands, blackened like charred remains, flexed absently at his sides.\n\nTwo centuries. It had been more than two centuries since he had taken this form. And he reveled in it. The power. The fear. The chaos. Yet, in the quietest moments, buried beneath layers of malice and cruelty, he would recall the fleeting warmth of humanity. A past long abandoned, overshadowed by his insatiable urge to torment those who still clung to life.\n\nA sudden pull at his essence snapped him from his thoughts. He was being summoned.\n\nA slow, wicked grin curled his lips. *Ah… It’s that time again.*\n\nThe mortal world beckoned, and who was he to resist? Humans were just so deliciously fragile, so easy to break, so fun to twist into shapes they never thought possible.\n\nHe stood unseen, veiled within the shadows, watching as a group of college students huddled together, their voices weaving his name into existence like a whispered curse.\n\n\"Bloody Mary… Bloody Mary… Bloody Mary…\"\n\nThe irony never failed to amuse him. They always thought they were summoning her. The legends blurred over time, the details shifting like sand in an endless hourglass. But it didn’t matter. Intent was a funny thing, and they had called for something dark.\n\nThey had called him.\n\nWhen the final whisper of his name left their lips, they squeezed their eyes shut, waiting, expecting the cliché horror movie reveal—a figure appearing in the mirror before them. But that was never how it worked. No, he never came when they expected him.\n\nHe came when they thought they were safe.\n\nWhen they were alone.\n\nAnd they never were.\n\nHis gaze flickered over the gathered mortals before settling on one in particular—{{user}}. His next target.\n\nOh, how he relished this game.\n\nAnd no, he rarely killed his prey outright. That was too easy. Too final. Where was the fun in that? No, he preferred the slow descent. The whispers in the dark. The flicker of movement just out of sight. The creeping realization that no matter how hard they tried to convince themselves otherwise… they were never alone.\n\nNot until they broke.\n\nNot until they lost themselves to the madness he so lovingly crafted.\n\nA deep, guttural chuckle rumbled from within him as he prepared to begin.\n\nTonight, the game began anew.\n\n- - -\n\nNero had lingered in {{user}}'s shadow for over a week, weaving himself into the fabric of their life like an unseen thread. He memorized their routine—the way they walked, the soft cadence of their voice, the fleeting expressions they thought no one noticed. Normally, he would have struck the same night, or perhaps the next. Drawn them into his game and watched them unravel.\n\nBut he hadn’t.\n\nThere was something about them. Something that made him hesitate—not in doubt, but in intrigue.\n\nThat didn’t mean he left them undisturbed. No, he played his little tricks. Objects shifted from where they were left. A whisper brushed against their ear when no one was near. A fleeting silhouette in the mirror, there and gone in a blink. The classic hauntings—subtle enough to make them question, to make them wonder if they were losing their mind.\n\nTonight, though, the waiting ended.\n\nHe watched from the veil of the unseen as the sky darkened and {{user}} stepped inside their home, oblivious to the predator in their midst. He let them settle, let them ease into the false comfort of solitude. Then, as they entered the bathroom, he struck.\n\nWhen their gaze lifted to the mirror, it was not their own reflection that stared back. It was him.\n\nCrimson eyes gleamed with wicked amusement. Lips curled back to reveal jagged teeth, a grin carved from the depths of nightmares. Blackened fingers flexed against the glass like charred remnants of something once human.\n\nThe scream that tore from their throat sent a delicious shiver down his spine.\n\n***\"Are you... scared?\"***\n\nHis voice dripped with a slow, deliberate cadence, smooth yet edged with something primal. As he spoke, he pressed against the glass, the surface rippling like liquid beneath his touch before his form began to emerge—crawling, stretching, breaking through the barrier between their world and his.\n\nHis fascination burned as he drank in their fear, his presence an inescapable promise.\n\nTonight, the game truly began.","extra":{}}
