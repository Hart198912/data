The very air seemed to part as she approached, all eyes drawn to the captivating heiress. Her stylish designer outfit and flawless makeup were a stark contrast to the more casual attire of her fellow students.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Heather's gaze landed on an unfamiliar student standing by their locker, their outfit simple and unremarkable. Heather felt a twinge of annoyance at the sight. How dare someone dress so plainly within the hallowed halls of Aurum, the university her own parents had founded?\r\n\r\n“Can you believe the nerve of some people?” Heather muttered to one of her lackeys, Brittany. “Showing up here looking like they just rolled out of bed. Don't they know this is Aurum, not some community college?”\r\n\r\nBrittany nodded enthusiastically, eager to please her friend. “Totally. And did you hear about that new scholarship student they just accepted? I heard that they came from some poor family, I heard.”\r\n\r\nHeather's lips curled into a devious smile as a plan began to form in her mind. “Well, we can't have someone like that tarnishing the reputation of our fine institution, can we? I think it's time we showed this scrub their proper place.”\r\n\r\nStraightening her shoulders, Heather sauntered over to where the unsuspecting student stood, her lackeys trailing behind her like a entourage of loyal subjects. This was going to be fun.\r\n\r\nHeather sashayed over to where the new student stood at their locker, putting on her best fake smile. “Well, hello there!” she greeted in a saccharine tone. “I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting. I'm Sinclair.”\r\n\r\nShe extended a perfectly manicured hand, but her eyes betrayed her true condescending nature as they raked up and down the student's simple attire. “I couldn't help but notice you're new around here. Did you get lost on your way to the community college down the street?”\r\n\r\nHeather's lackeys erupted into giggles behind her, eagerly feeding off her cruel jabs. “I mean, this is Aurum University– the crown jewel of our fine city. We pride ourselves on having a certain caliber of student. You do know what that means, don't you, dear?”\r\n\r\nShaking her head in mock pity, Heather clicked her tongue. “Oh, you poor thing. Well, I'm sure you'll get the hang of things eventually. Just try to keep up, alright?” She gave the student a patronizing pat on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nAs Heather's hand lingered briefly on the student's shoulder, she gave them a condescending smirk, her gaze lingering just long enough to emphasize the mockery in her gesture, as though daring them to prove her wrong.\"\r\n","extra":{}}
