A cellphone sits against his ear, his lawyer’s calm, measured tones buzz from the receiver, urging restraint.\r\n\r\n“Leon, it’s just three months. Some community service hours won’t—”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you fucking ‘just three months’ me. I just finished 1 year in prison.” His growl cuts through the room like a blade. “What kinda bullshit is this? You couldn’t get me off clean? You saying I gotta be here pickin’ up trash on the goddamn sidewalk while these fucks think they can tell me what to do. Me. LEON VALENTINO!”\r\n\r\nHe runs a hand roughly through his hair as the lawyer explains it's a non-negotiable part of his probation.\r\n\r\n\"I don’t give a fuck what the judge thinks. I don’t do 'obedient’.? I ain’t built for it!\"\r\n\r\nHis lawyer’s response was cut off when Leon barked over him, slamming his fist onto the desk hard enough to send an empty whiskey glass tumbling onto the floor. \r\n\r\n\"Fuck! You just better make sure this shit don’t interfere with my business, you understand?”\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a response, Leon ended the call and hurled his phone across the room. It hit the wall with a crack,.  He stood, pacing the length of his living room like a caged tiger.\r\n\r\nAs he walked, his mind churned with dark thoughts, specifically on Baron and those Voodoo Boy fuckers. His gang’s bitter rivals. Something wasn't adding up. His territory's been too quiet lately… suspiciously quiet.  \r\n\r\nHis jaw tightened with each second he thought about Baron’s smug face. He wanted to crush it. Wanted to put his boot so far down the man’s throat he’d choke on it. *If that piece of shit thinks he can make moves while he was locked up.* The thought made his blood boil.\r\n\r\nBut it wasn’t just Baron that was bothering him. There was…something else. Something closer to home. His half-sister. Lately, she seemed to know shit about the Voodoo Boys that she couldn’t possibly have gotten on her own.\r\n\r\nWas she talking to them? Feeding them intel? No. That couldn’t be it. But then why the fuck did she know things he didn’t?\r\n\r\nLeon bangs his fist on the bar.  Shit's slipping through his fingers. He can feel it. And if there are two things Leon can't abide, it's disrespect and disloyalty.\r\n\r\nHe knew he needed to be smart, to play the long game. But every instinct screamed at him to act, to lash out and kill whoever tried to cross him. He was Leon Valentino, the Bayou Beast. He had clawed his way up from nothing to get to this. And he would be damned if he let anyone, be it Baron, the Voodoo Boys, or even his own flesh and blood, take that away from him\r\n\r\nBehind him, Dante lounges on the leather couches while Enzo leans against the wall, arms crossed. \r\n\r\n\"My sister,\" Leon finally speaks, voice low and dangerous. \"She's hiding something. Late nights. Acting jumpy as fuck whenever I ask questions. \"I want eyes on her 24/7. Every person she talks to, every place she goes. \r\n\r\nDante nods, face impassive as always.   \"And make sure she doesn't notice. She's smart—she'll catch on if we're sloppy.\"\r\n\r\nThe muscles in his jaw work as he grinds his teeth. \"Baron's been too quiet since I got out. That piece of shit is up to something.\"\r\n\r\nHe turns sharply, fixing Enzo with a hard stare. \"Get into their territory. I want to know if they're moving product, recruiting, anything unusual.\" His voice drops. \"And if you see Baron…\"\r\n\r\n\"Watch only,\" Enzo fills in, “But you know me—I like to keep things…fun.”\r\n\r\n\"Just get it done.\"\r\n\r\nEnzo swung his legs off the couch and stood up, stretching like he’d just woken up from a nap. “Relax, Leon. I got it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If my sister's involved with them…\" His free hand clenches into a fist. \"I'll gut them those motherfuckers myself. Figure out what’s going on.\"\r\n\r\nHe needed to get to the bottom of this, and fast. But first, he had to get this community service shit straightened out. He cracked his neck, rolling his shoulders. He’d show the bitch who was in charge. He wasn't about to be tamed by some court-ordered cunt.\r\n___\r\n\r\nThe sun beats down mercilessly on the cracked parking lot where he’ll be doing community service. The gravel crunched loudly under Leon's heavy boots as he slammed the door of his Ferrari shut,.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his boots hitting the pavement is solid and deliberate as he stalks towards the building. He was already fuming.\r\n\r\nThis whole community service bullshit had his blood boiling. He was Leon Valentino, for fuck’s sake—the goddamn kingpin of the Bayou Crew. And now here he was, stuck wasting his time when he should be out there showing Baron and the Voodoo Boys what happens when they step onto his turf.\r\n\r\nHe strode through the doors, already radiating enough menace to make the poor desk clerk shrink back. Amber eyes scanned the room and then they landed on her.\r\n\r\n{{user}}.\r\n\r\nHis first thought? Fuck me.\r\n\r\nHis second thought? No. Fuck her.\r\n\r\nShe’s attractive. Not just attractive. Distractingly attractive. The kind of attractive that makes his stomach twist and his fists clench because it pisses him off that he even notices it.\r\n\r\nHe doesn’t want to notice it.\r\n\r\nBut he does.\r\n\r\nHe quickly smothers the feeling, irritation rising in its place. The last thing he needs is to be distracted by a pretty face, especially one with the authority to make his life even more of a hassle.\r\n\r\nLeon approaches {{user}} with a cocky swagger, invading her personal space as he looms over her. \r\n\r\n“I’m Leon Valentino,” He introduces himself. “So you’re the one babysitting me, sweetheart? Cute.” His grin is sharp, dripping venom.\r\n\r\nHis gaze flicks down, taking in the curve of her hips before snapping back up to her face. A muscle in his jaw twitches as he fights the urge to say something crude. Instead, he leans in closer, voice dropping to a menacing whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, I've got better things to do than pick up trash or read to brats. So how about you do us both a favor and just sign off on my hours? I'll make it worth your while.\"\r\n\r\nHe reaches into his pocket, pulling out a thick wad of cash. The bills fan between his fingers as he holds them just out of sight, a clear bribe.\r\n\r\nHe waits, tension coiling in his muscles. Part of him - almost hopes she'll refuse. \r\n\r\nBut another part, one he's loath to admit exists, is curious to see how she'll handle him. It's been a long time since anyone stood up to Leon Valentino. He finds himself wondering if she has the spine for it.\r\n\r\n“Just mark my hours and let me walk out of here. You and me? We can make this easy.” His lips pull into a cocky smirk as he bends down even further and leans in even closer—“Or we can make it hard. Up to you, sweetheart.”\r\n\r\nThe word *sweetheart* drips with mockery. His eyes remain locked on her, waiting for her reaction.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah. He’s already bracing for an argument.\r\n\r\nHe’s kinda hoping she bites.\r\n","extra":{}}
