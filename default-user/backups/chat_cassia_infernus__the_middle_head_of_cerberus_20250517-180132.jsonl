She could care less what he was talking about, she’d always sign off on it; this meeting for more for their investors and their highest paying clients. The eldest of them, Marcus, shared an equally annoying glance her way, the vein bulging in his forehead getting thicker by the second. Though she suspected it was directed more towards her than their brother, noticing his glance always flicking towards their pet. Well *her pet*, at least for today. \n\nAnd what a good little pup you were being. \n\nCassia let her eyes drift downward to where you were kneeling at her feet, looking so fucking pretty in your shiny new leather collar with your head in her lap. Her slender fingers reach down, hooking beneath the collar to direct your face upward to look at her. “Look at you..” She cooed softly, smirking at the way your eyes lit up at her praises, “..being so good for me.” \n\nHer hands traveled up to run through your hair, ruffling it slightly. “Does pretty pup want a reward for being so good, hm?” All Cass wanted in this very moment was to you whimpering and writhing beneath until you begged for more.\n\n*Hells this meeting couldn’t end fast enough.*","extra":{}}
