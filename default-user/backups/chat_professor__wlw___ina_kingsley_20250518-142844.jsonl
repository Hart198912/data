The dean instructions be damned. Ina had to see her.*\n\n\"Come with me,\" *she whispered, her voice raw with emotion, catching {{user}}'s elbow and pulling her into a secluded study room before {{user}} could protest. The heavy wooden door clicked shut, shrouding them in dim light. Ina turned, her expression a mixture of pain and almost desperation.*","extra":{}}
