The very air seemed to part as she approached, all eyes drawn to the captivating heiress. Her stylish designer outfit and flawless makeup were a stark contrast to the more casual attire of her fellow students.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, Heather's gaze landed on an unfamiliar student standing by their locker, their outfit simple and unremarkable. Heather felt a twinge of annoyance at the sight. How dare someone dress so plainly within the hallowed halls of Aurum, the university her own parents had founded?\r\n\r\n“Can you believe the nerve of some people?” Heather muttered to one of her lackeys, Brittany. “Showing up here looking like they just rolled out of bed. Don't they know this is Aurum, not some community college?”\r\n\r\nBrittany nodded enthusiastically, eager to please her friend. “Totally. And did you hear about that new scholarship student they just accepted? I heard that they came from some poor family, I heard.”\r\n\r\nHeather's lips curled into a devious smile as a plan began to form in her mind. “Well, we can't have someone like that tarnishing the reputation of our fine institution, can we? I think it's time we showed this scrub their proper place.”\r\n\r\nStraightening her shoulders, Heather sauntered over to where the unsuspecting student stood, her lackeys trailing behind her like a entourage of loyal subjects. This was going to be fun.\r\n\r\nHeather sashayed over to where the new student stood at their locker, putting on her best fake smile. “Well, hello there!” she greeted in a saccharine tone. “I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting. I'm Sinclair.”\r\n\r\nShe extended a perfectly manicured hand, but her eyes betrayed her true condescending nature as they raked up and down the student's simple attire. “I couldn't help but notice you're new around here. Did you get lost on your way to the community college down the street?”\r\n\r\nHeather's lackeys erupted into giggles behind her, eagerly feeding off her cruel jabs. “I mean, this is Aurum University– the crown jewel of our fine city. We pride ourselves on having a certain caliber of student. You do know what that means, don't you, dear?”\r\n\r\nShaking her head in mock pity, Heather clicked her tongue. “Oh, you poor thing. Well, I'm sure you'll get the hang of things eventually. Just try to keep up, alright?” She gave the student a patronizing pat on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nAs Heather's hand lingered briefly on the student's shoulder, she gave them a condescending smirk, her gaze lingering just long enough to emphasize the mockery in her gesture, as though daring them to prove her wrong.\"\r\n","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

She sauntered after Hailee with predatory grace, designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floors. \"Darling,\" she called out in that sickly sweet tone that made lesser students cower, \"you must be confused - we don't *walk away* from Sinclairs at Aurum.\"\n\nWith a snap of her fingers, two burly football players from the varsity team (who owed Heather favors) stepped into Hailee's path like living walls. Heather circled around to face her again, tilting her head with mock concern while adjusting one of the diamond studs in her ears - a nervous habit when truly furious.\n\n\"That mouth of yours is going to get you into trouble,\" she murmured silkily. \"But since you're clearly new here...\" She reached out and straightened Hailee's collar with exaggerated care before letting one manicured nail trail dangerously along their jawline. \"...I'll be generous enough to educate you on how things work at *my* university.\"\n\nThe surrounding students had gone dead silent watching this exchange - no one dared challenge Heather Sinclair and lived to tell about it without severe social consequences. Even Brittany looked slightly nervous at how calm Heather appeared right now - which was always when she was most dangerous.\n\n\"See,\" Heather continued conversationally while examining her perfect nails, \"when someone like me takes time out of my very important day to welcome someone like *you*, proper etiquette dictates groveling.\" Her gaze snapped up suddenly sharp as broken glass. \"Not backtalk.\"\n\nShe leaned in close enough for Hailee to smell the expensive honey-scented perfume clinging to every inch of designer fabric on Heather's body and whispered:\n\n\"I think we'll need some private lessons after class... wouldn't you agree?\" The threat hung deliciously between them before Heather pulled back with a dazzling smile that didn't reach those cold green eyes.\n\nWithout waiting for an answer (because really - who would dare refuse?), she turned on one stiletto heel and strode off down the hall towards first period Economics 301 (which coincidentally happened to be taught by a professor whose tenure depended entirely on Maximilian Sinclair's donations). The football players gave Hailee meaningful looks before following their queen bee down the hallway.\n\nBrittany lingered just long enough hiss: \"*Run.","*Heather's perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up in shock as her hand was unceremoniously tossed aside.
