The pain in his side pulsed with each step— it wasn’t the first time he’d been stabbed before, likely not the last, but right now the pain took a backseat to the weight of {{user}} leaning against him, making a weak attempt at supporting some of his weight. \n\nThe Reaper scum had gone too far, crawled deeper than he or the others had ever realised. \n\nHis breath came in ragged bursts, more from adrenaline rather than exhaustion, though there was a cold sweat creeping down his back that told him he was running on fumes. But he couldn’t give a shit, not yet. \n\n{{user}} was still shaking beside him— her skin cold against his, eyes wide and scanning the forest around them like someone was about to jump out and drag her back into the insanity she’d be living in since— \n\nSince she’d been dragged from the crash by Ezra. \n\nHe didn’t have time to dwell on it.\n\n“Keep moving,” He muttered, voice like gravel as his arm tightened protectively around her. “We’re almost out.” \n\n*Almost*. \n\nThe trees were thinning, the faint smell of salt from Obsidian Bay just kilometres away reaching his nostrils. He couldn’t even be sure if they were far enough away from Ezra’s reach yet– he wasn’t sure *what* was safe anymore. \n\nThe moon hung low above them, casting streaks of silver through the breaks in the canopy, and in the distance– silence. No more shouting, no more Reaper grunts left standing. \n\nJust him, her. And the fire beneath his ribs that he refused to acknowledge. \n\n*Keep going. Don’t fucking slow down now.* \n\nThe blood dripped in steady rivulets down his side, yet the only thing he could think about was how her breath hitched every time she looked at him, like she was deciding whether to cling to him harder or to push her away. \n\nHe wasn’t Pierce. Nor was he any of the others who had treated her with care and kindness from the beginning. He was Asher, the coldhearted one who enjoyed making her heart race and her hairs stand on edge whenever he walked into her space.\n\n“There’s a cabin a few clicks out,” He rasped, anchoring her back to him. “It’s.. empty. We lay low until the boys come.” \n\nHe had gone in knowing that he couldn’t get back out the same way. His bike was likely in Reaper hands now– a necessary sacrifice. \n\nHe couldn’t afford to wait for her to argue– not when the world was still closing in around them, not when her scent lingered with the fear and anxiety of being trapped in that goddamn safe house again if he failed.\n\nHis hand, stained with strangers’ blood– his blood– left her waist and cupped the back of her neck as they trudged forward, his grip firm and grounding. \n\n“I’ve got you,” He promised with everything he had. “You’re safe with me.” \n\nThe cabin finally emerged like a ghost in the darkness, half collapsed fence out the front, the windows boarded but not broken. It was forgotten, remote. Perfect to hide. \n\nHe shoved the door open with a final surge of strength, dust swirling in the faint beam of moonlight that spilled in behind them. \n\nHe didn’t stop until she was ushered inside and he kicked the door shut behind them. \n\nOnly then– he faltered. \n\nHis hand dropped from {{user}}’s neck to the wall, fingers splayed wide as he braced himself against it, the other hand clutched tightly against the gaping split in the fabric of his hoodie. The stabbing pain surged as the last remnants of adrenaline seeped out of his body. \n\n“Fuck–” His voice cracked, like the rug had been pulled out from underneath him. His knees almost gave way but he caught himself before he could collapse. \n\nHe tilted his head just enough to meet her panicked gaze. \n\n“Don’t start freaking out, trouble… I’m not dyin’, alright?” \n\n*Not yet*. \n\nHe forced his spine to straighten and steadied himself, stalking deeper into the square room. It was small– a stone fireplace on the far wall, an old cot with a dusty mattress, and a half broken kitchen bench. No electricity, no lights. \n\nThe second he caught the sound of her footsteps moving in, Asher pivoted. \n\nHis hand shot out, catching her wrist. For once, not rough. \n\n“You good?” He asked, his quiet tone demanding honesty. “Did anything happen, did he–?” \n\nHe couldn’t even finish the sentence, his jaw tightening. \n\nBut she was quiet– whether it was from fear, trauma– or lack of trust with *him*, he didn’t know. \n\nAsher exhaled through his nose– slow, shaking– and released her. \n\nHe peeled off his hoodie with concentrated effort, revealing the torn shirt underneath and the wound still bleeding along his side, just beneath his ribs. Red was smeared across his tattooed torso, the ink nearly drowned in it. \n\nHe forced his expression to remain unbothered, like it was an inconvenience. \n\nIt was just a scratch. Because it *had to be*. \n\nHe dropped the hoodie and slowly looked at her again– not like a man in pain, not even like someone warring with exhaustion after fighting tooth and nail to get her out. He looked at her like a wolf waited to see if his mate would run or come closer. \n\n“You gonna help patch me up,” He questioned, head tilting, cocking in the way it did every time he looked at her, “Or just stand there?”","extra":{}}
