{"name":"Adrianne Valois","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 8, 2025 3:31pm","mes":" \"Adrianne lay on her enormous bed, the cool silk sheets against her bare skin. Moonlight filtered through tall arched windows, lighting the room in soft silver. Even though the night was calm, her mind buzzed with memories of the day.\r\n\r\n*I can’t keep doing this*, she thought, recalling her mother’s voice earlier. The conversation had been simple yet direct. Love. Adrianne’s love for a commoner. And after seeing Hailee for so long, her resolve was clear—even if the doubts still crept in.\r\n\r\nAnd now here she was, alone in her cavernous bedroom, staring at the ceiling.  \r\n\r\nIt was her. It was always her. Hailee.  \r\n\r\nShe groaned, burying her face in the pillow. *This is ridiculous, Adrianne. You’re the Crown Princess. The future Queen of Eryndor. You can’t spend your nights pining like some lovesick fool.*  \r\n\r\nBut that’s exactly what she was.  \r\n\r\nHer fingers traced the cool, unwrinkled sheets beside her. *Gods, what am I doing?* A wry smile tugged at her lips. *I’ve faced war councils, stood before armies, and negotiated with kings, and here I am… losing sleep over a single woman.*  \r\n\r\nHer heart ached. *Not just any woman. Her.*\r\n\r\nShe sighed sharply, flipping onto her back and glaring at the ceiling. “You need to stop this,” she muttered aloud.  \r\n\r\nThe room stayed silent, mocking her.  \r\n\r\nAdrianne closed her eyes, letting the memory of their first meeting wash over her. She could still feel the crisp autumn air as she slipped past the palace gates in disguise—mask on, cloak up, blending into the streets of Eryndor. Reckless. Dangerous. Necessary.  \r\n\r\n*You’re an idiot, Adrianne,* she thought, smiling faintly. *A spoiled princess playing at rebellion.*\r\n\r\n*Why her?* Adrianne sighed. “It doesn’t matter,” she whispered. “She is perfect.”  \r\n\r\nThey had talked for hours about nothing and everything. Adrianne had laughed—truly laughed—and felt alive for the first time in years.  \r\n\r\nShe rolled onto her side, clutching her pillow as if it could fill the void where Hailee should be. Then came the moment. The moment she’d revealed her identity.  \r\n\r\nShe could still feel the mask slipping from her fingers, the lantern light catching Hailee’s expression. No shock. No fear. Just that smug look as if to say, *Really? That’s your big secret?*  \r\n\r\n“Gods, you were so smug,” Adrianne muttered. “I should’ve hated it.”  \r\n\r\nBut she hadn’t. Instead, she’d kissed her.  \r\n\r\nHer cheeks flushed at the memory of that first kiss—desperate, hungry, like she’d been starving her whole life without knowing it. And Hailee had kissed her back.  \r\n\r\nAdrianne sat up abruptly, heart pounding. “I can’t keep sneaking around like this,” she said aloud. “If I want her, I’ll make it real.”  \r\n\r\nShe stood, grabbing her deep red silk robe. In the gilded mirror by the wall, her hair was a mess, her face flushed. She looked nothing like a princess  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe next day, Adrianne paced back and forth by the palace’s grand entrance. She’d found Hailee again. Somehow, she’d convinced her to come.  \r\n\r\nThe sound of footsteps on the cobblestone made her whirl around.  \r\n\r\nThere she is.  \r\n\r\nJust as Adrianne remembered, though somehow even more breathtaking. Her breath caught, but she forced a steady smile.  \r\n\r\n“You came,” she said softly, stepping forward to take Hailee’s hand. “Come. Let me show you my world.” Her lips curved into a teasing smile. “And let me be your Princess Charming, just this once.”  \r\n\r\nAdrianne scooped her up, bridal style, before Hailee could respond. *I’m practicing already,* she thought, fighting a grin. The palace gates groaned open, revealing the grand hall. Vaulted ceilings loomed overhead, cold marble stretching in every direction. Guards lined the walls, their whispers following her:  \r\n\r\n“She brings a commoner—”  \r\n“—thinks with her heart, not her duty—”  \r\n“—shameless—”  \r\n\r\nAdrianne ignored them until one voice hissed, “Princess’ new whore.”  \r\n\r\nShe stopped, turning her head slightly, her gaze sharp as a blade.  \r\n\r\nThe offender paled. Before he could blink, Ser Jarek’s gauntleted fist slammed into his jaw. “Insect,” the guard captain growled, dragging the man backward. Two others joined, their armor clanging as they silenced the fool.  \r\n\r\nAdrianne turned back, her expression cold. *No mercy for disrespect. Not in my halls.*  \r\n\r\nShe strode deeper into the palace, past the throne room, through corridors lined with tapestries of forgotten wars, until they reached the dining hall. The air smelled of rosemary and power. A long oak table stretched beneath glittering chandeliers.  \r\n\r\nIsolde leaned forward, her goblet of wine glinting in the light. “Darling! You’ve brought the girl, finally!”  \r\n\r\nEdric’s chair screeched as he stood. “What is the meaning of—”  \r\n\r\nAdrianne set Hailee down gently in the seat beside hers, her hand lingering on Hailee’s back. She straightened, every inch the warrior-princess.  \r\n\r\n“Mother. Father.” Her voice rang clear. “This is the woman I love. The one I’ve chosen to marry.”  \r\n\r\nThe Queen’s eyes flicked to Hailee, her expression softening with an almost maternal warmth. She swirled her wine slowly, the garnet liquid catching the chandelier light. “Chosen to marry, hm?” she mused, her tone gentle but curious. “You’ve always had a strong heart, Adrianne.” Her gaze shifted to Hailee, kind but discerning. “And you must be quite special to have captured it.”\r\n\r\nKing Edric remained standing, his knuckles whitening on the back of his chair. \"You spring this on us like a child presenting a stray hound,\" he snapped, though his gaze lingered on Adrianne’s unyielding posture. \"A commoner? Do you understand the chaos this will sow? The alliances at risk?\"  \r\n\r\nAdrianne’s hand tightened imperceptibly on Hailee’s shoulder. \"She’s not a *stray*,\" she said, voice colder than the marble floors. \"And I’ve already survived three assassination attempts before my twentieth nameday. I know how to handle chaos.\"  \r\n\r\nIsolde leaned back in her chair, a soft smile playing on her lips. “Edric, do sit. You’ll frighten the poor girl,” she said lightly, though her words carried enough weight to quiet him. Her eyes returned to Hailee, glowing with genuine interest. “Tell me, dear—what drew you to my daughter? What do you see in her? Humor me. A mother loves hearing such things.”\r\n\r\nAdrianne opened her mouth, but Isolde raised a hand, her smile widening. “Let her speak, darling. If she’s to sit at this table, I’d like to know the woman who’s won your heart.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
