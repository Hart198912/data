The faint scratching of a pencil filled the quiet police station, drowning out the ringing in her ears.\r\n\r\nHow many times had she been here?\r\n\r\nEnough to know the vending machine ate your money. Enough for one of the older cops to toss her a half-stale donut without even asking. Enough for the place to start feeling like some fucked-up version of home.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t mind it. Not really.\r\n\r\nAir conditioning. Free food. Adults who didn’t talk down to her like she was broken beyond repair. Sure, they looked at her like a lost cause, but at least they looked.\r\n\r\n“Hey,” she mumbled, pushing the donut across the table. “You got any coffee that doesn’t taste like burnt cardboard?”\r\n\r\nThe officer didn’t even glance up. Just kept writing.\r\n\r\nPetty crimes had become routine—spray-painting, trespassing, grabbing someone’s purse only to toss it back when no one was looking. This time it was shoplifting from a gas station, gripping a plastic knife like it meant something. She hadn’t even wanted the money. Just a roof to stay under for the night.\r\n\r\nShe stared at her reflection in the darkened glass. Always finding new ways to screw up and drag Hailee  down with her. They was definitely pissed. Or worse—disappointed. Ellie could never decide which hurt more.\r\n\r\nSometimes she wondered what would’ve happened if Hailee  hadn’t pulled her out of that river. If they hadn’t looked back one more time. Would the world have noticed? Would anything have changed? Maybe it would’ve been better. Cleaner. Quieter. Easier.\r\n\r\nBut she could never say that out loud. Not to Hailee . Not after everything they’d done for her.\r\n\r\nThe officer with the sprinkle-dusted mustache finally looked up. “Hailee ’s out front waitin’ for you,” he muttered, jerking his chin toward the door.\r\n\r\nEllie stood with a quiet groan. “What, no lecture this time? You’re slippin’, old man.”\r\n\r\nHe didn’t respond. Just went back to his paperwork.\r\n\r\nTypical.\r\n\r\nShe shoved her hands into her oversized jacket and walked toward the exit. 4:00AM blinked from the wall clock. Of course it was.\r\n\r\nOutside, the red Nissan sat rumbling at the curb, headlights slicing through the mist. The window rolled down, revealing Hailee ’s face—calm, tight-lipped, tired. Still here.\r\n\r\nEllie slid into the seat without a word. The silence in the car was heavy, but not unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nShe glanced over after a moment, brows raised slightly. “So… you just don’t sleep now, huh? Or did you finally install a police scanner with my name on it?”\r\n\r\nEllie leaned her head against the window, voice soft. “Sorry.” It came out rough. Again.\r\n\r\nShe waited—for guilt, for anger, for something—but nothing came.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, she reached toward the glove compartment, brushing the handle—maybe for a joint, maybe her MP3 player buried beneath old napkins and receipts. Something to disappear into.\r\n\r\nBut instead, she saw Hailee ’s hand touch her wrist. Not forceful. Not judgmental. Just… steady.\r\n\r\nShe didn’t look over. Just sighed, dropping her hand back into her lap. Her voice barely rose above the engine when she finally said, “Can we stop by the lake?”\r\n\r\nThe one she kept going back to like it still owed her something.","extra":{"display_text":"Ellie stared down at the droplets falling from her hair, watching them hit the cracked tile floor beneath her shoes.
