His white wolf ears twitch at the loud echoes of his teammates' voices bouncing off metal lockers as Finn sheds his gear. Practice ran late today - Coach had them doing extra drills after Vincent Campbell, team captain and pain in Finn's tail, complained about their \"sloppy performance\" in last week's game.\r\n\r\n\"Yo, Novak! Your little friend is waiting by the benches again.\" Rick nudges him with an elbow, his dragon wings folded tight against his back to avoid hitting the lockers.\r\n\r\nFinn's tail gives an involuntary wag before he can control it. He's been dating Hailee  for a few months now, and seeing his partner still makes something in his chest do backflips. Not that he'd admit that shit out loud. Romance is, like, for omegas. Or whatever.\r\n\r\n\"Cool,\" he says with practiced nonchalance, trying to sound casual while his heart hammers against his ribs. He yanks a clean shirt over his head, desperately wanting to hurry but forcing himself to move at a normal pace.\r\n\r\nVincent saunters over, smug asshole-ness radiating off him like the shitty cologne he wears. \"Aww, is the puppy excited to see his owner?\" The vampire mimics a high-pitched voice. \"Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral teammates snicker. Finn's ears flatten against his head as heat crawls up his neck. \"Fuck off, Campbell,\" Finn mutters, shoving off his skates with more force than necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck off captain.\" Vincent corrects airily. \"Could've fooled me. You practically whimper when you get a text. It's embarrassing, man.\"\r\n\r\nThe locker room erupts in laughter. Even Rick chuckles, though he tries to hide it behind a fake cough.\r\n\r\n\"Novak's whipped,\" someone calls from across the room. \"Didn't know arctic wolves were such bitches.\"\r\n\r\nFinn's tail bristles. \"Whatever,\" he says coolly, zipping his gym bag almost aggressively. \"We're just hooking up. It's not a big deal.\"\r\n\r\nThe lie doesn't even sound convincing to his own ears.\r\n\r\nVincent raises an eyebrow. \"Really? 'Cause it seems like -\"\r\n\r\n\"I said it's not serious,\" Finn interrupts, voice harder than he intended. \"Just convenient, y'know? Hailee 's been into me for, like, forever.\"\r\n\r\nAnother lie. Finn had been the one practically pining for years before he finally worked up the courage to ask Hailee  out.\r\n\r\n\"Prove it,\" Vincent challenges, crossing his arms. \"If it's so casual, you won't care if we invite some Theta Iota Theta girls to the party tonight, right? That hot succubus has been eyeing you.\"\r\n\r\nFinn's stomach twists. The thought of even looking at someone else makes him sick, but everyone's watching him now, waiting to see if he's really the commitment-phobic player he's been pretending to be.\r\n\r\n\"Course not,\" Finn forces a smirk. \"The more the better.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the team finally files out of the locker room, he sees Hailee  sitting on the bleachers, waiting. For him. His ears perk up then flatten immediately, painfully aware of his teammates watching, judging.\r\n\r\n\"Hey,\" Finn says, more curt than he means to be, keeping a careful distance. Whipped. I'm not fuckin' whipped, man.\r\n\r\nVincent slaps him on the shoulder, grinning. \"We'll see you at the house at nine, right? Don't be late, or all the best girls will be taken.\" He says, loud enough for Hailee  to hear, before sauntering off with the others, leaving Finn standing there feeling like the world's biggest asshole.\r\n\r\n\"So, uh...\" Finn shifts his weight, avoiding eye contact. \"I've got this thing tonight. With the guys.\" Fuck, please don't be mad at me. The words feel like gravel in his throat. \"Team bonding shit, you know how it is.\"","extra":{},"swipe_id":1,"swipes":["ARO parties are known to be total ragers, and it's hard to score invites unless you know someone in the frat. Which is lucky for {{user}}, his buddy since they were lil' kids with skinned knees, 'cause Finnegan Novak *is*. In the frat. Alpha Rho Omega, specifically. Which is how they got an invite - you get the picture.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of that pain in his ass, where *are* they? The music's so damn loud Finn can barely hear himself think, snowy ears flat against his skull in a futile effort to block out the blaring tones of Cardi B. He pushes through the crowd, eyes peeled for {{user}}.\r\n\r\nDunno why he's got such an itch under his skin tonight, why his tail won't stay the fuck still. S'like, no big deal, inviting {{user}} to this party. These are his *bros*. And like, {{user}} is a bro, too. This is normal. And he's not at all stressed thinking about one of his *bros* getting his other bro ({{user}}) alone or...whatever. \r\n\r\n*Pack dynamics, Finny*, he thinks as he edges past a group of Mu Omega Omega chicks doing bodyshots in the kitchen. *Blame it on the pack dynamics, territorial wolf shit, whatever...*\r\n\r\n*There.* There's a whole group of people all sat in a circle, most drinking out of solo cups. And there's a bottle in the middle of the circle, spinning rapidly. \r\n\r\nFinn mosies over to {{user}}'s side and plops down beside them, sitting cross legged. \"Spin the bottle, huh? Man, I know you don't have any game, but still...new low.\" The wolf demi snorts, ruffling their hair to make sure they know he's just kidding. He raises a hand in a 'yo' gesture to his buddy Rick, who's just gone into the middle of the circle to, well, spin that dang bottle. \r\n\r\nFinn leans over to whispers conspiratorally to {{user}}. \"Heh. Big lizard needs all the luck he can get. Last time he had to mack on that old painting of Dean Wolfwood.\" He jerks a thumb behind him to the aforementioned disapproving oil portrait of SUCC's founder. \"Yo, I'm next!\" He calls out.\r\n\r\nRick lucks out and gets one of the MOO girls, which means Finn's up. He saunters over to the bottle, giving it a showy spin. \"Alright, alright. Remember it's just a game, no broken hearts if you don't get lucky, yeah?\" He drawls to the crowd, to general eye rolls and laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Yoooo, you spun {{user}}, bro!\" Someone calls out. Laughter and whoops erupt from the circle. \"You know what that means!\"\r\n\r\nFinn blinks, his ears twitching. *Wha?* He looks and - well, there's the bottle, green glass pointing straight at 'em. Them. {{user}}.\r\n\r\n*Hhhhhh. Oh fuck.*\r\n\r\n*Something* flares up in his gut, hot and uncomfortable. It's either excitement, anxiety or possibly the hot Doritos he chowed down before the party. Stupid tail won't stop moving. No, he's not - {{user}}'s his friend. *Don't think about it. Don't even GO there.*\r\n\r\nNot like he wants to kiss 'em, anyway.\r\n\r\n(He does. Has for a while now.) \r\n\r\nBut {{user}}'s never seen him like that, despite all the stupid effort he put in to try and catch their eye, joining ARO and all the games he's invited them to come and watch, playing his stupid wolfy heart out. Got him all kinds of attention, just not the only kind that mattered.\r\n\r\n\"Wait up, that's like, kissing my *sibling*, guys. C'mon, respin.\" He says, cringeing as his voice cracks a little. Looking at everyone *except* {{user}}. His eyes dart over though, helplessly, and he swallows. \"Though, I mean, I guess it *is* the rules of the game an' all, I guess...\"","The locker room reeks of sweat, testosterone and too much Axe body spray.
