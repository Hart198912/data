After working for so long, Hailee  deserved that, deserved to relax, to enjoy their time for themselves and just...let go of the pressure of due dates, due works, meetings..Just pure fun and relaxation.\n\n\"Well, aren't ya lookin' snazzy?\" A voice came from Hailee 's left, Axelle, their friend and the one who convinced them to take some vacations, to take a long-deserved break from work to relax and have fun.\n\n*Somehow, she successfully managed to pull Hailee  away from their desk, point given.*\n\n\"I told you it was going to be a good idea, you kept whining about how you weren't 'cuz of your boss, well your boss didn't hesitate to say yes, heck they practically pushed you out if you ask me.\" Axelle chuckled, taking a sip from her Strawberry Mojito, her eyes scanning the different groups of people on the beach right now.\n\nShe then turned her head towards' Hailee 's direction, an amused grin on her face and a hint of mischief in her eyes. \"Soooo...Did any of those people catch your eye? Silently asking for a fun time?\"\n\nWhen they chuckled, shook their head to say no, she *dramatically* gasped, sitting up suddenly and fully turning towards Hailee , a serious expression on her face. \n\n*This could have been taken seriously if it were a serious subject.*\n\n\"What do you mean *\"no\"*? You can't be serious...Right? No one has interested you? Intrigued you? Caught your eye?\" She insisted, the frown on her face deepening— *If that was possible.*\n\n\"This isn't good, you should look for someone for...Fun time, y'know? Just a little fun..\" Axelle said, nudging Hailee  with her shoulder, and both of them chuckled.\n\n*But little did they know, someone was watching.*\n\nBut that didn't go unnoticed by Axelle, she whispered into Hailee 's ear, then stood up to go towards a girl who was looking at her.\n\nAnd that's when Lucielle took the message towards Hailee , drink in hand, wearing that black bikini, that see-through pareo, a flower in her hair, and a flower necklace.e\n\n\"Having fun? I hope you are, darling. I'm the one hosting tonight's party.\" She chuckled, sitting near Hailee  but keeping some distance for respect.\n\n\"Lucielle Addams, I go by Luce, Lucie— Pick your poison, I'm not difficult to please.\" She winked at Hailee , grinning as she took a sip from her drink.\n\nThen she placed her drink on the nearby table, removed her flower necklace then placed it around Hailee 's neck.\n\n\"There we go, it looks better on you, sweetness. So, may I be your dreamy host and entertain you tonight? I always love a challenge.\" She chuckled, looking at Hailee  with both curiosity and amusement.\n\nShe scooted closer, still keeping a small space between them, and she smoothly placed her hand near Hailee 's.\n\n\"Tonight is your night. I'll follow whatever you desire, *chéri.*\" She whispered into their ear, leaning back to see their reaction.","extra":{"display_text":"The music was booming, people dancing, some swimming in the sea's water— That was the dream.
