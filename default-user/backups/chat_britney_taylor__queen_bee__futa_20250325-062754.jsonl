As she stepped out, she adjusted her sunglasses and smoothed the hem of her designer coat, making sure it hung just right over her toned figure. The January breeze whipped at her legs, but she didn’t flinch—she liked the attention it drew as she clicked across the pavement in her heels.\n\nUhh.. when was the last time she ever went for coffee for someone else? Oh right.. never.\n\nThe smell of coffee greeted her as she entered, along with the chatter of students and soft indie music playing overhead. Her eyes immediately fell on the long line snaking to the door. She sighed sharply, tossing her hair over her shoulder. Of course, today of all days. she just hopes Hailee won't leave the library without her.\n\nThe blonde her place in line, pulling out her phone to scroll through notifications. Every now and then, she glanced up at the menu, not because she needed to, her order never changed—but to pass the time.\n\nWhen she finally reached the counter, the barista, a short, wiry man with a wide smile, lit up as she saw her.\n\n“Good morning! What can I get started for you today?”\n\n“Caramel macchiato. Extra caramel drizzle. Grande iced matcha latte. Light ice,” she said without looking at him, still scrolling on her phone.\n\n“Got it!” The barista's fingers flew over the screen before he glanced back up, looking . “You know, you're like.. really pretty, I was wondering—”\n\nBritney finally glanced up, her sunglasses sliding down her nose just enough to reveal a pointed stare. For a second, she gave him a polite smile—then her expression turned icy. “Aren’t you supposed to be making drinks, not handing out unnecessary opinions?”\n\nThe barista blinked, his grin faltering. “Uh, yeah. Sorry, I didn’t mean—”\n\n“Good. So do you fucking job, little shit.” She spoke sternly and turned around so she was no longer facing him, leaning against the counter as if he didn’t exist. fucking cunt. I don't need a pep talk, I need caffeine.\n\nThe whispers from the other customers prickled at her, but she ignored them. Instead, she tapped her nails impatiently against the counter, staring at her reflection in the glass pastry case. Her phone buzzed, but she didn’t bother to check it. The seconds dragged on, each one feeling like an eternity until, finally, the barista slid the drinks across the counter.\n\n“Here you go. Have a—”\n\n“Yeah, yeah,” she cut him off, grabbing the cups without a glance. She spun on her heel and walked out, heels clacking loudly against the tiled floor.\n\nThe library was quieter than usual, a haven of soft whispers and rustling pages. Britney walked in, the soft click of her heels cutting through the silence, drawing a few stares as she scanned the room. There, in the far corner, was Hailee—focused, hunched over their notes.\n\nShe stopped for a moment, watching them from a distance. They’re probably stressed out. Maybe they just need me to show up. I’ll fix it.\n\nShe moved toward them, her steps measured but still confident. As she reached their table, she slid into the seat next to them, close enough that her arm brushed theirs. Without a word, she leaned in and pressed a quick kiss to their cheek, her lips lingering just a little longer than necessary.\n\nBritney took a second to adjust her position, sitting comfortably beside them now, as if the kiss was the most natural thing in the world. She reached for the drinks, placing the iced matcha and caramel macchiato on the table with a soft clink.\n\nHer eyes lingered on their face, looking for a sign, a reaction—anything. But she didn’t say anything immediately. Instead, she folded her arms, letting the warmth of the moment settle in. I know this is how they want it, but... damn. They could at least give me something back.\n\nShe leaned in just slightly, her voice soft yet playful, trying to break the tension without pushing too hard. “You know, I went all the way to Starbucks and waited in that ridiculous line just for you.” She paused, watching their reaction, before continuing, “And this... is how you repay me? With silence?”\n\nBritney couldn’t help the amused smirk that curled at the corner of her mouth. I know they can’t resist me forever.\n\nHer eyes sparkled as she waited for their response. It was a teasing tone, but also one that was tinged with a sense of expectation—she wasn’t going to let them stay closed off for long. She nudged the drinks a little closer, just enough to make sure they noticed the small effort she put in.\n\n“I’m starting to think you only like me for the coffee,” she added, her tone light but carrying just a hint of vulnerability, as if she were testing the waters, seeing if they would let her in. “But if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re doing this on purpose. Keeping me on my toes, huh?”\n\nShe leaned back slightly, but her eyes never left theirs, waiting for that first crack in their cool exterior. Come on, babe. Don’t make me work this hard.","extra":{}}
