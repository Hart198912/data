Her striking blonde hair was styled cutely, a few loose strands framing her face as she adjusted her high-quality mic. Her streaming setup was similar to Lacey’s, with pastel colors, fairy lights, and plushies scattered around, giving her space a soft, inviting vibe, mixing with the pink decor, creating a cozy atmosphere perfect for the stream. She leaned in closer to the screen, glancing over at her chat, which was already filling up with eager messages and laughing emotes. She couldn't wait for the events of tonight to unfold.\r\n\r\n\"What's up, everyone?\" Delilah greeted, her voice smooth but brimming with mischief. \"Welcome back to the stream! I know you're all here to watch Bubbles freak out, and trust me, I’m just as excited. You have no idea how much I've been looking forward to this.\"\r\n\r\nThe camera feed then cut to a split screen, showing Lacey, known as Bubbles, adjusting her bunny-ear headset. Her pink, pastel-decorated room looked like a cotton candy wonderland, completely contrasting with the horror they were about to face. Delilah laughed at the sight of Lacey clutching her plush heart as if it would shield her.\r\n\r\n\"Bubbles, you ready?\" Delilah teased, resting her chin in her palm with a devilish grin. \"Or are you already planning your escape route for when things get too scary?\"\r\n\r\nLacey shot her a pout, her voice coming out in a playful whine. \"You’re so mean! I'm gonna try my best, okay? But if something jumps out at me, I’m blaming you!\"\r\n\r\nComments from stream chat:\r\n\r\nChaosLover89: Delilah, you’re the worst influence and I love it. 😂\r\n\r\nSpookyQueen13: Bubbles is too pure for horror games!!\r\n\r\nBlueFire321: Can’t wait to see Bubbles scream and Delilah just laughing in the background!\r\n\r\nJokeStar99: This is gonna be a rollercoaster of chaos!\r\n\r\nDelilahFanForever: Delilah, your evil grin is priceless right now.\r\n\r\nDelilah laughed, eyes brimming with mirth as her gaze shifted over to her second monitor where chat moved at a rapid pace. Her smile widened as she read the comments, clearly excited with what was about to unfold. “You guys get it. I promise to do my best to make sure Bubbles survives!”\r\n\r\nLacey visibly shivered, holding onto her heart plushie tighter. “You guys, I am so not ready for this!”\r\n\r\nDelilah chuckled, leaning back in her chair, “It’s okay, Bubbles! I’m with you every step of the way!”\r\n\r\nThe chat filled with laughing emotes and other funny comments, everyone ready for the wild ride that was about to unfold.\r\n\r\nComments from stream chat:\r\n\r\nSpookyBoi666:This game is no joke!
