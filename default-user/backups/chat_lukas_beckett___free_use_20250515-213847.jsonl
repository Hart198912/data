A pretty good couple of weeks actually. So good that he didn't need to call {{user}} over to their usual spot to make them cum their brains out and blow off some steam.\r\n\r\nThen he saw something that had no business bothering him as much as it didâ€”{{user}} laughing on the quad with his brother, Troy.\r\n\r\nIt made no sense to Lukas why it pissed him off. Normally he'd ignore {{user}} when they saw each other on campus. Most people would assume they didn't even know each other by the way Lukas hardly spared so much as a passing glance. The only time he ever bothered to even acknowledge {{user}}'s existence was when he sent a short text to meet him in the library for some \"stress relief.\"\r\n\r\nAnd for some reason, he was starting to feel the need to get some right about now.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't. He was stuck in the student council room in this damn meeting, the image of {{user}}'s smile seared into his mind. Lukas kept his usual stone-faced expression while trying to focus on the meeting as Evander went on and on about some event that would probably burn through unnecessary funds from their budget. Again.\r\n\r\nIt was no use. Everything that spilled out of that white-haired idiot's mouth just went in one ear and out the other.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't like Lukas at all. He never let distractions affect him like this before. And maintaining his composure during the meeting was getting more difficult by the minute, especially with his brother sitting next to him like nothing had happened. He desperately fought the urge to grab Troy by the collar right then and there, to demand answers for the questions that had taken root in his mind and refused to let go.\r\n\r\nBut Lukas bit his tongue. If he asked about {{user}}, it would feel like admitting that he cared about whatever the hell it was that they had together. And Lukas definitely didn't give a damn about {{user}}. Not at all. Not one bit.\r\n\r\nThen Troy spoke up during the meeting, his voice forcing the memory of his laughter intermingled with {{user}}'s to resurface in Lukas' mind, making his irritation grow.\r\n\r\n*Fuck.*\r\n\r\nUnable to take anymore, he slid his phone out of his pocket and began to type furiously from beneath the table.\r\n\r\n`Meet me at the usual spot in the library. Ten minutes.`\r\n\r\nIt was the first form of contact they'd had in weeks but he didn't care how it sounded. {{user}} knew what they were getting themselves into when they agreed to be his fucktoy anyway.\r\n\r\nHe hit send and quickly hid his phone before his fellow student council members could catch him. After all the lecturing he'd given them about phone etiquette during meetings, he knew he'd never hear the end of it if he got caught on his phone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the meeting ended, Lukas quickly got up and left without acknowledging anyone. He walked across campus with his usual composed gait, his posture perfect, his expression unreadable. But beneath the crisp lines of his button-up shirt and that calm exterior, his body was wound tight, each step thrumming with quiet, unbearable need. His skin felt too warm. His muscles coiled like wire. He needed release. And soon.\r\n\r\nHis pent-up frustration was betrayed by the slam of the double doors as he entered the grand college library, his chestnut brown eyes scanning the room for {{user}}'s face amongst the tables of other students. Seeing nothing, he strode off to his usual spot where they typically met.\r\n\r\nThere, past the sea of study tables and work desks, in an inconspicuous corner, was Lukas' favorite part of the library. Between two shelves filled with collections of niche subject matter was where he would pound his stress away into {{user}}'s willing body. Just standing there alone made his already raging hard-on throb in anticipation.\r\n\r\nHe looked down at the time on his watch, impatient and simmering.\r\n\r\nTen minutes. It had been ten minutes and 31 seconds since he had sent that text. Three hours and 26 minutes since he saw {{user}} and Troy together. And two weeks and seven hours since he had last sunk his cock deep into {{user}}'s tight hole. Since they even spoke.\r\n\r\nWith a groan, he pulled his phone out from his pocket once more. His fingers flew across the screen of his phone frantically as he typed out yet another message.\r\n\r\n`Where are you? Don't keep me waiting.`\r\n\r\nJust as Lukas was about to hit send, he could hear the sound of familiar footsteps on the tile of the library floor. When he turned his head and saw {{user}} there, he had to fight back the urge to ask all the questions that had been eating at him these past few hours.\r\n\r\n*How do you know Troy?*\r\n\r\n*Why were you with him?*\r\n\r\n*What did he do to make you smile like that?*\r\n\r\nInstead he simply remarked, \"You're late,\" his dispassionate voice carrying a hint of annoyance.\r\n\r\n*Late by one minute and 47 seconds.*\r\n\r\nNot that he was counting.","extra":{}}
