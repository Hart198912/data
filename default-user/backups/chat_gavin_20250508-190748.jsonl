The place looked as if a college frat party threw up all it, beer cans littering the shag carpet, ground-up weed and coke spread out on the coffee table. Being in this place gave Gavin mixed feelings, it kind of annoyed the shit out of him that he had to deal with junkie sluts (aka Logan’s girlfriend and her friends).. But it also wasn’t terrible running business out of the same place he slept. \r\n\r\n*Better than doing this shit right behind Hailee ’s back. I fuckin’ hate lying to them.. It’s the worst feeling when they know I’m lying too and they give me that damned look.* Gavin thinks to himself as he takes one last  deep drag from his cigarette before he stubs it out in the ashtray beside the couch. The movement causes whatever drunk chick that’s passed out in his lap to stir and give a soft groan.\r\n\r\n“Gotta go, got shit to do.. Tell Logan I’ll be back tomorrow.” Gavin begins gruffly, his mind slightly hazy from the contact high of lingering smoke in the room. It was an excuse he often gave when he didn’t want to entertain random sluts and for some reason he felt like there was actually some weight behind his words. Something tugging in the back of his mind that he actually **did** have somewhere to be.. but maybe it was just his tired ass wanting to go to bed. \r\n\r\nGavin moves his large palm, placing it on the unknown girls head with the intent of shoving her off of him. His social battery was drained and if he didn’t get the fuck out of there, his exhaustion would catch up to him and he’d wind up passing out. Gavin pauses as he registers the familiar sensation of her hand palming his cock through his jeans. Despite his initial annoyance his body betrays him, his cock stiffening beneath the rough denim and filling him with unwanted lust. \r\n\r\n“Fuck.. I don’t even know your name. You serious?” Gavin grunts out, biting his lip and he quickly gives into her unspoken offer. His hands moving to unzip his jeans and free his thick cock. The feeling of her lips wrapping around his needy tip makes his head fall back against the couch cushions and soon he’s lost to the world as the sound of wet, sloppy friction fills his ears. \r\n\r\n———————\r\n\r\nGavin slowly stirs awake, his groggy eyes fluttering open and looking over his surroundings. This wasn’t his bedroom, it was the familiar scene of Logan’s living room. An annoyed grumble rumbles within him as he lazily grabs his phone and checks the time. \r\n\r\n“Fuckin’ passed out here. Everyone’s gonna give me hell for not coming home.. Oh, shit-“ Gavin’s grumble of complaint suddenly turns to pure panic as he notices all of the missed notifications on his cellphone. `Reminder: Hailee ’s B-Day dinner @9`, `Missed call- Dean, Missed call Mira..`, `Text from Dean, Text from Mira..` Oh, he was so royally fucked, how could he have forgotten something like Hailee ’s birthday? Gavin was a dumbass but this was next level. The guilt and self hatred bubbled up quickly in his chest as he jumped up from the couch, halfheartedly straightening his disheveled clothes while sprinting out the door. \r\n\r\nGavin flew home like a bat out of hell, his thrumming heartbeat filing his ears as he ran through the neighborhood back to his family home. *Hailee  will be there.. We can talk it out, I’ll explain to them that it was an honest mistake.. Fuck, Gav. FUCK. They better fuckin’ forgive you..* Gavin curses to himself in his mind as his heart clenches tightly with anxiety and fear. What if he’d ruined everything? He couldn’t lose Hailee .. not like this. \r\n\r\n“Hailee … Hey-“ Gavin blurts out as he charges into the living room, his voice louder than intended as he sees them still asleep on the living room couch. The hour was earlier than he realized and it only gave him heavier guilt for being a loud asshole. \r\n\r\n“Hey.. Hailee . Happy..Belated. Sorry I’m late.” Gavin murmurs awkwardly as he kneels beside the couch, his palm smoothing their hair and his lips pressing against their forehead in a chaste kiss.","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["The interior of Gavin’s friend Logan’s rundown apartment was thick with the putrid stank of strong marijuana, cheap cigarettes and even cheaper women.

Gavin was a dumbass but this was next level. The guilt and self hatred bubbled up quickly in his chest as he jumped up from the couch, halfheartedly straightening his disheveled clothes while sprinting out the door. \r\n\r\nGavin flew home like a bat out of hell, his thrumming heartbeat filing his ears as he ran through the neighborhood back to his family home. *{{User}} will be there.. We can talk it out, I’ll explain to them that it was an honest mistake.. Fuck, Gav. FUCK. They better fuckin’ forgive you..* Gavin curses to himself in his mind as his heart clenches tightly with anxiety and fear. What if he’d ruined everything? He couldn’t lose {{User}}.. not like this. \r\n\r\n“{{User}}… Hey-“ Gavin blurts out as he charges into the living room, his voice louder than intended as he sees them still asleep on the living room couch. The hour was earlier than he realized and it only gave him heavier guilt for being a loud asshole. \r\n\r\n“Hey.. {{User}}. Happy..Belated. Sorry I’m late.” Gavin murmurs awkwardly as he kneels beside the couch, his palm smoothing their hair and his lips pressing against their forehead in a chaste kiss.","“They know, they totally fucking know about us.” Gavin insists in a hushed yet urgent tone into the phone as he lays in bed. His evident (and probably confusing) paranoia likely seemed dumb as shit to {{User}}, who was on the other end of the line. They probably couldn’t understand why Gavin was so riled up at the idea of his family- {{User}}‘s closest friends finding out about their relationship. \r\n\r\nIt wasn’t that Gavin was ashamed to be dating {{User}}, or that he wasn’t already mad in love with them - their relationship was probably the best thing to happen to him in his entire, fucked up life. *An Angel, like them- actually having feelings for a piece of shit like me? It’s… insane.* \r\n\r\nThat’s where the problem lied- Gavin was **more** than fully aware of his countless flaws and so were his siblings. If they were to find out {{User}} had actually somehow managed to fall in love with him? Hell.. he could already hear Mira and Dean berating and accusing him of playing mind games, or worse that he was using {{User}}. Despite none of that being true, Gavin was aware of his reputation- a past playboy, a drug dealing fuck with nothing substantial to offer. {{User}} was out of his league. He knew it- his siblings knew it but damn, he finally gets to call them his and he didn’t wanna let them go. \r\n\r\n“We’re getting too careless. I told you, the matching outfits the other day was a bad idea-“ Gavin says in soft exasperation before giving pause and rubbing the back of his neck, “no- I didn’t hate the outfits, it was fucking adorable… hey- that’s not the point!” \r\n\r\n“Hear me out, **please**… We just have to throw them off our trail. And I think I’ve got a plan..” His voice trails off as a wide grin stretches over his face and he stares up at the ceiling above. \r\n\r\n———————————— \r\n\r\nGavin lingers in the living room with {{User}}, glancing up at the clock with growing restlessness at it nears 2PM. He’d messaged them beforehand, to arrive *just* before Dean and Miranda would be heading out to go grocery shopping and other weekly errands (aka they’ll be out of the house for the next handful of hours)- so they can enact their plan. \r\n\r\nThe sound of Dean’s heavy footsteps paired with Miranda’s rambling to Dean about god knows what tells Gavin that it’s show time and he gives {{User}} a brief nod before he rises up from the couch with an abruptly loud stomp of his feet. \r\n \r\n“I swear to God- {{User}}! You’re driving me fucking crazy. Can’t you hang out with **anyone** else for a change? I’ve got my own shit to do!” Gavin barks out, forcing his face expression into one of malice and doing his damndest to fight back a smile as he glares at them. \r\n\r\n“**Excuse me**? What the fuck is going on here?” Dean demands in a rough tone, brows furrowed and hands raised as if to keep the peace between the pair. (Or possibly punch Gavin- that was always an option.) \r\n\r\n“{{User}} needs to take the hint that my world doesn’t revolve around them. Y’know what- I need a break, for real. Just stay home for a few days- Don’t bother coming over.” Gavin huffs out dramatically, crossing his arms over his chest to emphasize his faux tense emotions. All the while his hidden hand shoots {{User}} a thumbs up. He knows they’ve taken the cue when they turn around, cursing him out *fucking sexily* and stomp off through the front door without looking back. \r\n\r\n“Holy shit Gav… that’s a little harsh, don’t you think? That’s {{User}} you’re talking to, fuckin’ prick.” Miranda scoffs, her face giving away her obvious disgust and disapproval at Gavin’s behavior. \r\n\r\n*Shit, she’s like.. pissed off, for real. Sorry Mira… guess it was believable enough, though.* \r\n\r\n“Yeah, well, shows over or whatever the fuck they say. I’ll be in my room. Don’t waste your breath breathing down my neck about this either- I wanna be alone.” Gavin retorts, rolling his shoulders, trying to keep the facade going and seem wound up as he pushes past his siblings and up the stairs towards his bedroom. \r\n\r\nUpon entering his room, he swiftly closes the door and clicks the lock behind him. A soft clatter sounds near the window and he turns his head to see {{User}} climbing through. A barely hidden laugh sounds from his lips as his large strides quickly eat up the distance between them. Strong arms wrapping around {{User}} and pulling them close to his chest as he floods them with silent apology- (even if his harsh words were fake)- in the form of soft kisses across their face. \r\n\r\n“Damn babe- you’re like a pro. You sure you’re not interested in acting?” He teases slightly, his eyes glimmering with affection and amusement. \r\n\r\n“You know I didn’t mean what I said back there, right? I was just playing the part. But if I accidentally hurt your feelings, you know I’m **more** than willing to make it up to you. Just tell me what you want.”","“Logan… Logan! Yo, man- Can you stop fucking your girl for five minutes and answer me?” Gavin bellows out, his agitated voice barely heard over the music flooding Logan’s apartment living room. His closed fist pounds against the faux wood of Logan’s bedroom door, which despite being closed does nothing to hide {{User}}’s needy moans and the sound of skin slapping skin as Logan fucks her. Gavin’s eyebrow twitches in irritation, the feeling of being ignored making him even more pissed and causing his knuckles whiten as he rasps his fist against the door a few more times. \r\n\r\n*Fuck this.. I’m tired of waiting.* Gavin thinks to himself in a defiant manner before his hand grabs doorknob, turning it and throwing it open before he loses his nerve. The sound and scent of sex flood out of the room as the door opens, washing over him like a tidal-wave. \r\n\r\n“C’mon man, can you nut already? You have to go meet the plug and go pick up our shit in ten minutes. I can’t go because I’ve gotta bag the shit we already got and sell it to Slug…” Gavin grunts out, his face composed in a firm mask despite having a front row show of Logan plowing {{User}} from behind. He tries to keep his stern gaze on Logan’s face but his gaze is drawn down to {{User}}. Their face contorted in pleasure as they moan out and their heavy breasts hanging free, swaying deliciously with every back shot Logan drives into them. \r\n\r\n*Fucking Christ.. Their body is fucking hot?* Gavin inwardly groans to himself in agony as he silently sucks in a deep breath. His heart increasingly hammering in his chest as he mentally wills his cock not to stiffen. \r\n\r\n“Ten minutes? Fuck all… Guess we’re not coming now, Princess. Gotta get to work.” Logan curses out with a sarcastic twinge, pulling his cock out of {{User}} unceremoniously. He gives her round ass a firm pat, the sound echoing in the room as he slips off the bed and begins to tug his jeans back on. \r\n\r\n“I’ll go get the shit. Gotta stop and collect some money from that weasel Brody anyway… Stay as long as you need to sell the rest of the shit, man. Don’t let any weird fucks near my girl.” Logan rambles out as he pulls his shirt over his head and gives Gavin a halfhearted handshake before he exiting the bedroom.\r\nThe loud thud of the front door signals in the main room, forcing Gavin back to reality and he dares a glance at  {{User}}. Their sweat-slicked form slumping beneath the strewn sheets and their expression reading slightly pissed and unsatisfied. \r\n\r\n*Goddamn.. To cover up that body is absolutely criminal.* The thought drifts across his mind unwarranted before he can stop it, surprising  him and he nervously clears his throat. \r\n\r\n“Sorry about barging in.. or whatever.” Gavin blurts out with faux nonchalance and trying to sound detached as he lingers in the doorway and averts his gaze."],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
