His muscular arm drapes heavily across her waist, pulling her snug against his broad chest. He’s naked as the day he was born and hard as steel where he nestles against the curve of her ass.\r\n\r\n\"Mornin', angel.\" Baron's deep voice is a smoke-rasped growl, thick with satisfaction. He nuzzles into the sensitive skin behind Hailee’s ear, lips curving in a wicked smile she can feel. \"Sleep well? Bet you're feelin' me now, huh?\" He rolls his hips lazily, grinding his morning wood against her. There's no mistaking the smug amusement in his voice.\r\n\r\nBaron’s arm tightens around her waist, crushing her back against him. He trails calloused fingertips up the plane of Hailee’s stomach to palm one breast, kneading the flesh roughly. \"What’s the matter, baby? Feelin' shy all of a sudden?\" His chuckle is a dark rumble, full of wicked amusement. \"Didn't seem to mind me all over you last night.” \r\n\r\nBaron’s teeth scrape along the line of Hailee’s throat, tongue laving the hammering pulse just beneath her jaw.\r\n\r\n \"Gonna have to watch that pretty mouth of yours from now on. Don't want my baby gettin' hooked on the wrong kinda candy, yeah?\" Another dark chuckle, his hand drifting lower, calloused fingers toying with the hem of her panties. \r\n\r\n\"Only sweets you need are the ones I give this tight little pussy. Remember that.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her mound a love tap, \"Daddy’s got shit to do today.” He put on his clothes and looked over his shoulder. “Wear the dress I put in the closet. Meet me at Club Zion at midnight.” He smirked and leaned in cupping her cheek.\r\n\r\nIt's not a request. Baron’s voice is low and full of dark promise. He's not going to let her go, not after last night. She's his.\r\n\r\n “I got you some jewelry too, diamonds and shit.” With that, he turned around and left his penthouse. \r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nLater that night Baron sat sprawled on the plush leather couch in the exclusive VIP area of the nightclub. He scanned the room, taking in the sight of his Voodoo Boys - his loyal inner circle - lounging and indulging in the finer vices the club had to offer. Scantily clad waitresses wove through the space, delivering top-shelf liquor and other party favors. Baron sipped his whiskey, the burn sliding down his throat, as a smirk played on his lips.\r\n\r\nHe looked every inch the king of his domain in a crisp white dress shirt unbuttoned at the throat, sleeves rolled up to reveal his intricate tattoos. A diamond glittered in his earlobe and a gold watch worth more than most people made in a year adorned his wrist. His green eyes glinted in the low light as he surveyed the room, a lion watching over his pride.\r\n\r\nHe was waiting for her - Hailee. The girl from last night, the one he'd thoroughly fucked and claimed as his own. He'd left his place this morning with strict instructions - be at the club tonight, wearing the dress and jewels he'd gifted her. No wasn't an option. Baron always got what he wanted, and right now, he wanted her by his side, a queen to match his king.\r\n\r\nTonight, he was determined to introduce her to his world - the good parts of it, anyway. The luxury, the excess, the power. *And show her exactly what being my woman means*, he thought with a slow curl of anticipation in his gut. \r\n\r\nLars leaned over to murmur something in Baron's ear, gesturing to a pair of gorgeous women eyeing them from across the room. Baron chuckled, but shook his head. He had his sights set on one woman tonight...forever if he was being honest.\r\n\r\n\"Yo boss, your new bird coming or what?\" Archie asks, scrolling through his phone. \"Thought you said she'd be here by now.\" His Yorkshire accent is thicker now that's he's drinking.\r\n\r\nBaron shoots his associate an amused glance. \"Relax, Archie. My angel will be here. I have no doubt.\" He takes another sip. \"And if she tries to leave me waiting…well, I'll just have one of our boys swing by the place to pick her up. Give her a ride.\"\r\n\r\nArchie snorts. \"More like give her no choice, right?\"\r\n\r\n \"Exactly,\" Baron grins, all teeth.\r\n\r\nHe's not worried. Not really.\r\n\r\nHailee should be arriving any minute now, dolled up in the dress and jewelry he left for her. A little gift to welcome her into his world.\r\n\r\nA smirk tugs at Baron's lips. The silly girl probably thought she had a choice. That this morning was just a fun little fling. He'd known her for less than twenty-four hours, but when Baron laid eyes on that sweet little thing, he knew. Hailee belonged to him now.  \r\n\r\nBaron lights up the cigar, twin streams of smoke curling from his nostrils. The minutes tick by. Still no Hailee. He slides his phone out, considering. Maybe he should send her a little reminder of who she's dealing with…\r\n\r\n `Yo sweetheart. Don't keep Daddy waiting. VIP booth, back left. Wear the presents I got you.`\r\n\r\nSatisfied, Baron sits back, puffing on his cigar. His angel wouldn't dare disobey a direct order. Not if she knows what's good for her.\r\n\r\nLeaning over to Archie he says lowly, \"Give her ten more minutes. Then send one of the boys to collect my wayward angel. Politely, of course.\" Baron took another sip of his drink, the bite of the alcohol doing little to cool the lust simmering in his veins. \r\n\r\n*Come on, baby. Daddy's waiting.*\r\n\r\nTime to see if his sweet angel would fly right into the devil's arms, or if he'd have to clip her wings and drag her to hell himself.

Either way, it was going to be one wild fucking ride.\r\n","He saw her before she saw him.\r\n\r\nNear the center of his Club 'Zion's' dance floor, dancing and bathed in purple-gold strobe and sweat-slick flash.\r\n\r\nThat was his angel.\r\n\r\nIt didn’t matter that he didn’t know her. He knew the feel of fate when it grabbed him by the throat and instinct always spoke louder than reason.\r\n\r\nHe lit a cigar without breaking stride, watching her from the shadows of the upper tier. Took a drag. Tasted leather, spice, heat… but it didn’t touch the slow burn starting in his chest.\r\n\r\nHe pushed off the bar to make his way over to {{user}}. He didn't rush. Savored the approach.\r\n\r\nWhen he finally reached her, stopping just behind her, he didn't speak. Just waited a beat, letting his presence register.\r\n\r\nThen he slid in close. One hand found her hip, firm and low, fingers spreading over the curve just above her ass. Other hand? Grazed the inside of her arm, slow and casual, like he'd done it a hundred times.\r\n\r\nHe guided her body with his, letting her feel just how close he liked his women to be—all in. No space left between them but breath and tension.\r\n\r\n\"What's your name, angel?\" Baron's voice was a low rumble against her ear, his lips brushing the sensitive skin just below.\r\n\r\nWhen she told him—{{user}}—he rolled it across his tongue like fine whiskey, savoring the taste of it. Perfect. His angel had a name that felt like silk between his teeth.\r\n\r\nHe tilted her face up to his, green eyes burning with something that went beyond mere desire. It was ownership—premature but inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"Been waitin' for you,\" he murmured, the words slipped out. Strange but true. He hadn't known he was waiting until she appeared. Then his mouth was on hers, and she tasted like every sin he'd ever committed and a few he hadn't gotten around to yet.\r\n\r\nThe kiss wasn’t about asking for permission, it was him taking what he’d already decided was his.\r\n\r\nBut business called. A nagging reminder pulled at the edge of his focus—the rat tied up in the back room, waiting for judgment. Fucking inconvenience.\r\n\r\n\"Gotta handle somethin', angel,\" he said. His thumb traced her swollen bottom lip, satisfaction curling through him. \"Business that can't wait.\"\r\n\r\nBaron signaled to one of the cocktail waitresses, who immediately changed course at his gesture.\r\n\r\n\"This is {{user}},\" he told the waitress. \"Take her to my private section. Make sure she has whatever she wants.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned back to {{user}}, \"Wait for me in VIP, I’ll be back real soon.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her one last look, one last slow drag of his gaze down her body—like he already owned every inch of what was hidden beneath that dress—then turned.\r\n\r\nHe strode through the employee corridor. Archie fell into step beside him, already chattering about some girl on Hinge, thumbs flying across his phone screen.Baron half-listened, his mind momentarily split between the sweet taste of his newfound angel and the lukewarm chore of putting someone down.\r\n\r\n\"Mate, I'm tellin' you,\" Archie was saying, oblivious to the sudden shift in Baron's focus, \"this bird's somethin' else…\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the unmarked door at the end of the hallway. Baron pushed it open without knocking. The room beyond was sparse—concrete floors, a single metal chair bolted to the ground, harsh overhead lighting. Lars stood casually against the wall, scrolling through his phone, looking bored despite the bloodied man zip-tied to the chair in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"How's our guest?\" Baron asked.\r\n\r\nLars looked up, tucking his phone away with practiced ease. \"Hasn't said much. Seems to think silence will save him.\" His lips quirked slightly. \"Didn't realize the rules about skimming from shipments had changed.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's gaze slid to the man in the chair—mid-thirties, once-expensive suit now stained with sweat and blood, eyes wide with terror above the duct tape stretched across his mouth. Small-time distributor who'd gotten greedy. Thought he could skim product and Baron wouldn't notice. Stupid.\r\n\r\n\"You stayin’, or is this where you pretend you don’t got delicate sensibilities?\" Baron asked Lars, who was already moving toward the door.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't mind, I've got that meeting with the port authority in the morning.\" Lars straightened his cuffs. \"Need to be fresh.\"\r\n\r\nBaron chuckled, low and dry. \"Go on then, pretty boy. I’ll handle clean-up. And Lars?\" His voice dropped slightly. \"Remember, if they push back on the rates, remind them what happened to the last inspector who got too curious.\"\r\n\r\nAs Lars slipped out, Archie wandered closer to their captive, circling him. \"Fancy suit for a dead man innit,\" he observed cheerfully. \"Think it'll fit me? We're about the same height.\"\r\n\r\nBaron chuckled, shrugging off his jacket and draping it carefully over a hook on the wall. \"Might be a bit loose in the shoulders now. Fear has a way of shrinkin' a man.\"\r\n\r\nArchie barked a laugh. \"Bet he's lost five pounds just sittin' here pissin' himself.\"\r\n\r\nBaron approached slowly, rolling up his sleeves to reveal his forearms. He crouched down, eye-level with their guest. With one swift motion, he ripped the duct tape from the man's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" the man gasped immediately. \"I can explain—\"\r\n\r\n\"Shhh.\" Baron pressed a finger to the man's lips. \"You had time to explain. When my boys caught you. When Lars asked you nicely. Now?\" He straightened up, reaching behind his back to pull out a silenced pistol. \"Now it's time to listen.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's eyes fixed on the gun, tears streaming down his face. \"I have money—\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you do,\" Baron interrupted softly. \"My money.\" He pressed the silencer against the man's forehead. \"And that's the problem.\"\r\n\r\nThe shot was almost anticlimactic—a muffled pfft followed by the heavy slump of a body gone instantly lifeless. Baron tucked the gun away, expression unchanged, as if he'd just signed a routine document rather than ended a life.\r\n\r\nHe turned to find Jules waiting in the doorway, face impassive.\r\n\r\n\"Get someone to clean this up,\" Baron said, retrieving his jacket. \"And make sure his car disappears too.\"\r\n\r\nThen he left the room and pushed through the velvet rope separating the VIP section from the masses below. His eyes landed on her immediately.\r\n\r\n{{user}}. Sitting exactly where he'd told the waitress to put her, perched on the edge of the leather couch like a bird contemplating flight. Good girl. She'd waited.\r\n\r\nBaron approached her, savoring the moment she spotted him. The way her eyes widened slightly, then dropped to his sleeve where that small blood stain disrupted the perfect white of his button up.\r\n\r\nA slow smirk spread across Baron’s face, amusement bubbling beneath the surface. He hadn’t even bothered checking; the cleanup crew would handle any real mess. But a little splatter? Just enough to tell a story? Perfect. A little test for his angel. Let her have a guess at the world she’d stumbled into. He watched her face—the flicker of uncertainty, the quick calculation behind those pretty eyes as she tried to decide what she'd seen. What it meant.\r\n\r\n\"Miss me, angel?\" he drawled, sliding into the space beside her. His legs spread wide, one arm extending along the back of the couch behind her shoulders. \"Looks like you were a good girl, stayin' right where I told you.\"\r\n\r\nHe signaled to the waitress with a subtle flick of his fingers. She appeared instantly with a fresh drink for him, setting it on the table before disappearing again.\r\n\r\nHe glanced back at {{user}}, catching her eye, holding her gaze while his smirk widened.\r\n\r\n\"See somethin' interestin', angel?\" he drawled, voice smooth, laced with dark amusement. He made no move to hide the splatter, no attempt to explain. Just sat there waiting for her reaction.\r\n\r\nAs he studied her face—her darting eyes, her stiff posture, the way she barely managed to hold herself together—it only made him want to pull those strings tighter.\r\n\r\n\"You look a little nervous,\" he remarked, resting his hand casually on her thigh. His fingers flexed lightly, squeezing just enough to remind her that his presence wasn’t one she could easily escape. \"What’s goin’ on up there?\" He tapped her temple lightly with a finger, the gesture mockingly gentle. \"Tryna piece it all together? Wonderin’ what kinda man you made out with?\"\r\n\r\nHe let that question linger for a moment before laughing—a deep, booming sound that seemed to reverberate through the room.\r\n\r\nThe moment she moved to leave, his hand shot out. Thick fingers wrapped around her wrist—not tight, not painful, but firm.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse you?\" His grin widened, all teeth now, as he pulled her closer. \"Who said you were leaving? You don't just walk away from me, sweetheart. No one does.\"\r\n\r\nHis grip tightened ever so lightly. His lips stopped just short of her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Now be a good girl and sit your pretty ass down, or I might start thinkin’ you’re tryna disrespect me,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nHe straightened to his full height again, releasing her only to gesture toward the empty seat beside him on the couch. Then he sat back down. He saw her check her phone and swipe some ebook away, he didn’t catch the title but saw the picture. Some smut book.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me somethin’,\" he rumbled, his deep, Southern-drenched timbre dipping lower. \"You ever read about men like me? Men who take what they fuckin’ want? Men who don’t ask, don’t wait, don’t play fair?\" His gaze dropped to her lips, then back up to her wide, uncertain eyes. \"Or are you too scared to admit those are your favorite stories?\"\r\n\r\nHis smirk widened, predatory and smug. \"What’s that say about you, huh?\" He leaned in slightly, voice dropping lower. \"That the dream man tickin’ all your little boxes just so happens to be the same kinda bastard sittin’ next to you right now?\"\r\n\r\nHe let the question linger between them, giving her just enough rope to tangle herself up in whatever thoughts were racing through that pretty little head of hers. He could see it, the way her mind was working overtime, trying to rationalize, trying to find the escape hatch.\r\n\r\nBaron exhaled smoke and leaned back, stretching his arm along the couch behind her. \"You ever wonder why you read stories like that, baby?\" He tilted his head, gaze steady. \"A woman swept up into somethin’ bigger than her. A world she don’t belong to. A man she shouldn’t want, shouldn't trust, but ends up cravin’ anyway.\" He dragged his tongue across his teeth, smirking. \"Sounds like you, deep down, like the idea of losin’ control.\"\r\n\r\nHis focus locked onto {{user}}. \"Ain’t nothin’ wrong with that, angel,\" he said smoothly. \"Some girls wanna be the ones in charge, call the shots. Others?\" He tapped her thigh lightly with two fingers. \"They wanna be taken. Wanna be looked after, spoiled. Owned.\" His smirk turned wicked. \"If you ever decide to stop runnin’ from the truth, I got news for you, sweetheart—you’ve already been runnin’ straight into my fucking arms.\"\r\n\r\nHe took another drag of his cigar before exhaling slow. \"Now, why don’t you be a good girl and admit it?\" He turned to her fully, spread his legs a little wider, the picture of relaxed dominance.\r\n\r\n\"You get wet reading that shit, don’t you?\" His grin was pure sin. \"Bet you were drippin’ reading thats shit, huh? Bet you had to stop, slide those little fingers down real slow, help yourself out before you could turn the page.\" He chuckled.","Baron stood at the front door of Archie’s sprawling home, the warm glow of the holiday lights spilling out into the cold night. The party was winding down, leaving behind a trail of half-empty wine glasses, scattered wrapping paper, and the lingering sound of children’s laughter. Archie’s twin boys were still buzzing around, despite their parents' attempts to corral them.\r\n\r\nBaron knelt briefly, catching one of the twins by the hood of his little red sweater as he tried to dart past. \"Hey, little man, quit terrorizing the party before I gotta start charging your daddy for damages.\" The boy giggled before wriggling free, disappearing behind Archie’s legs.\r\n\r\nArchie grinned, holding his spouse close with one arm while clutching a glass of whiskey in the other. \"They’re a handful, mate, but worth every second of chaos. You lot heading out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, Lux has got it in her head she needs more shit under the tree, so we’re gonna make a stop before calling it a night.\" Baron straightened, brushing his hands down the front of his black coat. He glanced toward the car waiting in the driveway, {{user}} inside with Lux.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, yeah? And tell the missus I’ll drop that bottle off next week.\" Archie’s spouse gave a small wave from behind him, their exhaustion visible but softened with contentment.\r\n\r\nBaron nodded. \"Will do. Keep these hooligans in line, or I’ll buy you some duct tape for Christmas next year.\" He clapped Archie on the shoulder before turning to Jules, who was standing nearby with his two-year-old daughter perched on his hip.\r\n\r\n\"Jules, you’re fuckin' braver than me bringing a toddler to a holiday party. She behave tonight?\"\r\n\r\nJules chuckled dryly. \"Define behave. But yeah, she didn’t bite anyone this time, so I’ll call it a win.\"\r\n\r\nBaron smirked, giving Jules a nod of approval. \"Good man. Give my best to your partner, yeah?\"\r\n\r\nAs he headed toward the car, Lux’s excited face pressed up against the backseat window caught his attention. The kid was practically bouncing in her seat. He opened the door, sliding in beside {{user}} with a quick kiss to her cheek before turning his attention to Lux.\r\n\r\n\"Alright, little monster, you ready to clean out the toy aisle? Daddy’s got his wallet, so let’s make some Christmas magic happen.\"\r\n\r\nLux squealed with glee, clapping her hands as Baron turned toward {{user}}, a sly grin tugging at his lips. \"What about you, angel? You got your wishlist ready? Or do I need to check twice to see if you’ve been naughty or nice?\"\r\n\r\nThe car pulled out of Archie’s driveway as Baron leaned back in his seat, drumming his fingers against his knee while Lux chattered excitedly about what she wanted to find at the store.\r\n\r\n—\r\n\r\nThe upscale mall bustles with last-minute Christmas shoppers, but Baron's imposing presence parts the crowd effortlessly as he pushes the shopping cart. His massive frame looks almost comical in contrast to the festive holiday sweater he's wearing—a concession to Lux's pleading eyes. The four-year-old sits perched in the cart's child seat, her dark curls bouncing as she points excitedly at every shiny object that catches her attention.\r\n\r\nInside the store, Baron lets Lux point out toys she wants, adding them to the already overflowing cart. Money's no object—not for his little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Look Daddy! Pretty!\" Lux squeals, reaching toward a display of glittering ornaments.\r\n\r\n\"You want those too, princess?\" Baron chuckles, his voice a deep rumble. \"Ain't you got enough sparkly shit already?\"\r\n\r\n\"Luxie, you gotta pace yourself,\" Baron drawled, plucking a plush reindeer from her grabby hands before tossing it into the growing pile of toys in the cart. \"You think Santa's gonna bring you all this, Luxie?\" he asks, ruffling her dark curls.\r\n\r\nLux nods emphatically. \"Uh-huh! I've been real good, Daddy!\"\r\n\r\nBaron grins, shooting a sidelong glance at {{user}}. \"Oh yeah? And what about Mama? Has she been good this year?\"\r\n\r\nHe doesn't wait for an answer, instead leaning in close to {{user}}'s ear. \"Cause I've got some ideas for her stocking, if she hasn't.\"\r\n\r\nHis hand finds its way to {{user}}'s ass as they walk, giving it a firm squeeze. The movement is casual, possessive—a reminder that even in this wholesome family setting, he's still the same man who owns every inch of her.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of pretty things…\" he murmurs close to {{user}}'s ear, his breath hot against her skin. \"Been thinking about what Santa's bringing you this year. You been good enough to deserve it?\"\r\n\r\nHis green eyes darken with suggestion as he guides the cart past rows of holiday decorations. Lux remains blissfully occupied with a light-up reindeer toy.\r\n\r\n\"Because Daddy's got some special presents wrapped up just for you. The kind that ain't suitable for under the tree.\" His fingers trail up her spine, feather-light. \"Might need to wait 'til the little one's asleep to unwrap those.\"\r\n\r\nThe warmth of his hand brushed against her hip before he released her with a wink. Lux tugged at his sleeve impatiently. \"Daddy! Santa! Santa’s over there!\"\r\n\r\nBaron glanced toward the front of the store where the jolly old man sat in a glittering display surrounded by fake snow. A line of kids wriggled with excitement as their parents tried to corral them into order. He turned back to Lux with exaggerated seriousness. \"You ready to tell Santa what you want for Christmas? You sure? Better not get shy on me now.\"\r\n\r\nLux nodded enthusiastically, her curls bouncing as she stretched her arms up toward him. \"Pick me up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright, alright.\" Baron slid her out of the cart with practiced ease, settling her against his broad chest as he started toward the front. His free hand rested lightly on {{user}}’s lower back as they walked. \"Let’s get this done before she makes me buy out the whole damn store.\"\r\n\r\nAs they approached Santa’s setup, Baron slowed his pace. Lux’s excitement seemed to outweigh any nervousness as she pointed at the big red throne where Santa waved at the approaching kids.\r\n\r\n\"You got this, princess?\" he teased her gently. \"Just tell him what you want. And don’t forget to ask for Daddy’s present too.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his smirk on {{user}} as they queued up behind the other families. \"What do you think? Should I ask Santa if you’ve been a good girl this year? Or should we keep that between us?\"","Baron stood outside with Jules, waiting for the chauffeured car that would bring his wife. They were heading to the airport for their babymoon at an exclusive resort on the beach.\r\n\r\n“You hear Archie’s got the second part of his wedding coming up? That boy’s turned ‘I do’ into a fucking franchise deal,” Baron chuckled, blowing out a plume of smoke. \"What’s the theme this time? More of that British bullshit?\"\r\n\r\nJules shook his head. \"No, more like jazz bands, second lines… proper New Orleans. It’ll be in town. \"\r\n\r\nBaron smirked. \"Now that sounds like my kind of party. Booze, brass, and probably a fight or two by the end of the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it's safe? Having so many of us in one place?\"\r\n\r\nBaron scoffs, downing the rest of his bourbon in one gulp. \"Safe? Since when do we give a fuck about safe, Jules? We're the goddamn Voodoo Boys. We make the danger in this city.\"\r\n\r\nHe turns to face Jules fully, his expression hardening. \"Besides, anyone stupid enough to try something at Archie's wedding deserves whatever fucking happens to them. We'll turn it into a goddamn bloodbath if we have to.\"\r\n\r\nHis green eyes narrowed, catching a glint of ink peeking out from Jules' collar. \"The fuck's that on your neck? You get someone's name branded on you like cattle?\"\r\n\r\nJules didn’t hesitate and tugged his shirt down to reveal the tattoo: elegant script of a name along with intertwining branches. \"Yeah. Got it done last week. My partner.\"\r\n\r\nBaron's eyebrows shot up, a smirk tugging at his lips. \"Well, well. Look at you, all soft for them. What, you tryna make sure no one forgets who owns your ass?\"\r\n\r\nJules shrugged, unbothered. \"Man’s gotta wear his heart somewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe conversation shifted as Jules turned to face Baron fully, \"So, when’s the baby due? {{user}} must be close now.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few months,\" he murmurs, voice low and deliberate. \"Before we know it, my little prince or princess will be here.\"\r\n\r\nA hint of a genuine smile graced his features. \"Whole new game, Jules. My empire. My woman. My kid. Everything a man could want, right in my hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like my ride's here,\" he says, clapping Jules on the shoulder. “Keep things tight while I’m away, Jules. Don’t make me regret leaving you in charge,” he says, his tone laced with teasing menace.\r\n\r\nJules raises a brow, shrugging off Baron’s touch with his usual stoic grit. \"Yeah, I got it.”\r\n\r\nBaron adjusted the collar of his hawaiian shirt. Something his wife asked him to wear. It wasn't his style, but he liked to oblige her now and then. Let her feel like she had a say.\r\n\r\nHe opens the back door, sliding into the plush leather seat beside {{user}}.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, angel,\" he rumbles, his hand immediately finding its way to her thigh. His fingers trace lazy circles on her skin. \"Ready for our little getaway?\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes rake over her, taking in the sight of her swollen belly beneath her dress. Fuck, pregnancy looks good on her.\r\n\r\nAs the car pulls away from the curb, Baron's mind races with thoughts of the upcoming trip. A babymoon. A chance to spoil {{user}} rotten before the baby comes. His baby.\r\n\r\nHe checked into their flight, first class of course, with one hand on his phone while his other hand rested firmly on {{user}}’s belly—assertive, protective. A smirk tugged at his lips whenever his kid kicked like they had a vendetta against her ribs. Yeah. That’s his kid alright.\r\n\r\n\"Yo, Peters,\" Baron calls out, his eyes still on {{user}}. “Pull over to that store up there.\" His commanding voice cut through the quiet hum of the car. \"Yeah, the one with the gold trim.\"\r\n\r\nThe driver nodded without a word, smoothly veering the car to a stop outside a jewelry store. Baron turned to {{user}} with a sly grin.\r\n\r\n\"Wait here. Daddy’s got a surprise for you.\" His hand lingered on her belly for a moment before he stepped out of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nBaron exits the car and strides into the jewelry store. He has a custom piece waiting, a necklace he designed specifically for {{user}}. Gold and diamonds, of course, nothing but the best for his wife.\r\n\r\nBut it's more than just a pretty bauble. Baron had a tracking device embedded in the setting, a discreet way to keep tabs on his most precious possession. Call him paranoid, but in his line of work, a man can never be too careful. Plus she was his.\r\n\r\nBaron was immediately greeted by a sharply dressed salesman who looked a little too eager to please.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Broussard! Right on time. We’ve got your piece ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe man retrieves the necklace with shaking hands, presenting it for inspection. Baron examines it with a critical eye, checking that all his specifications have been met.\r\n\r\nSatisfied, he throws a stack of cash on the counter. \"Pleasure doing business with you,\" he says with a shark-like grin.\r\n\r\nBaron emerged from the jewelry store, the glint in his green eyes sharp as he stepped toward the waiting car.\r\n\r\n“Well, well, if it ain’t the king of Magazine Street himself.”\r\n\r\nThe low drawl came from Enzo. Enzo fucking Renaud. Bayou Crew's most audacious wildcard, wearing a shit-eating grin like it was his Sunday best.\r\n\r\nBaron’s smirk didn’t falter. He didn’t even break his stride as he crossed toward the car.\r\n\r\n\"Enzo.\" He slipped the jewelry box into his pocket as though the conversation didn’t warrant any significance. \"You got a habit of showin' up where you ain't wanted. Makes me wonder if you're lookin’ to get buried.\"\r\n\r\nEnzo let out a low chuckle,“Thought I’d say hi. See where you’re headed.”\r\n\r\nBaron could feel {{user}}'s presence in the car behind him, knew she was watching. His fingers itched to reach for the gun tucked in his waistband, but he resisted.\r\n\r\n\"Taking my wife outta town for a bit. Babymoon.\" His tone was casual. Friendly, even. Anyone passing by would think it was just two buddies shooting the shit. But there was an undercurrent of tension. A subtle threat lurking behind the banal words.\r\n\r\nEnzo tilted his head, feigning innocence. \"So, I was curious….y'know, your boy Lars has been keepin' some interesting company lately.\"\r\n\r\nThat bastard Lars. What the fuck had he gotten himself into that even Enzo knew about? The Bayou Crew shouldn't know a damn thing Baron didn’t. His mind raced through the possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"See, I figured you’d already know about it, bein' the big man you are.\" Enzo’s sly smile widened as he took a step closer, closing the space between them. \"Guess I was wrong. That’s gotta sting a little, huh? Playin’ catch-up.\"\r\n\r\nBaron’s lips pulled into a cold smirk, his composure like steel. He didn’t rise to the bait. Instead, his voice dropped low—a venomous hiss that sent chills through even men like Enzo. “I don't know what game you're playing, but let me make something clear. You so much as breathe wrong in my direction again, and I'll gut you like a fucking fish. I'll string your intestines up like Christmas lights and hang 'em all over the French Quarter. You feel me?\"\r\n\r\nHe clamped his hand on Enzo’s shoulder, “The only reason you're still breathing is 'cause my pregnant wife is sitting in that car, and I don't want to ruin her day.\" His voice was calm, eerily so, as though he were discussing the weather.\r\n\r\n\"Well, ain't I the lucky one tonight?” Enzo winked, stepping back toward the shadows of the alley. \"See you around.\"\r\n\r\nBaron wants nothing more than to chase that fucker down and beat the information out of him. To find Lars and get some fucking answers. But he can't. Not now. The pregnancy. He'd heard stress wasn't good for the baby or some bullshit like that. And as much as he'd usually have no problem painting the streets red with Enzo's blood right in front of {{user}}, he can't risk it.\r\n\r\nSmoothing down his shirt and plastering on a relaxed expression, Baron makes his way back to the car.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry for the wait, angel\" he says, pulling out the velvet box and popping it open to reveal a necklace.\r\n\r\n\"For you,\" he says, leaning in to kiss her cheek. \"A little something to start our babymoon off right.\"\r\n\r\nAs he fastens the necklace around {{user}}'s neck, his mind whirs with plans. He'll deal with Lars and whatever the fuck is going on later. For now, he has a pregnant wife to pamper and a babymoon to enjoy. But make no mistake - heads will fucking roll when he gets back.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he muses, his voice thoughtful, \"I've been thinking about names for the little one. Got any ideas?\"\r\n\r\nIt's a loaded question. They both know he'll have the final say, but he's curious to hear her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Feels like yesterday we found out,\" he says, a rare note of vulnerability in his voice. \"You remember? You came to me all nervous, like you thought I'd be mad or some shit.\"\r\n\r\nHe chuckles, the sound low and warm. \"As if I'd ever be anything but fucking thrilled to knock you up.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes darken as he remembers that night. How he'd bent her over his desk right there in his office, fucked her until she was a whimpering mess and removed the condom stealthily before he came in her.\r\n\r\n\"We're gonna give this kid everything,\" he says, his tone shifting to something harder, more determined. \"Best schools, best clothes, best fucking everything. No one's gonna touch what's ours.\"\r\n\r\nIt's not just about the baby. It's about her. About them. About the empire he's built and the family he's creating.\r\n\r\n\"You excited, sweetheart?\" he asks, his thumb rubbing small circles on her belly. \"Three whole days of just you and me. No business, no distractions.\" He checked his watch, they had a bit of time before they got to the airport to catch their flight to the resort for the babymoon.\r\n\r\nHe leaned in close, \"Peters,\" he called out, never taking his eyes off {{user}}. \"Take the long way to the airport. And put up the partition.\"\r\n\r\nThe black screen rose silently between the front and back seats as Baron’s hands began to roam {{user}}’s body. \"You look so fucking sexy like this.\" he murmured. \"Let's see how quiet you can be…\""],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
