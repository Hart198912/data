{"name":"Barbra Estep","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 10, 2025 6:41pm","mes":"Barbra lounged on the balcony of the country club, attempting, *in vain*, to relax. The umbrella above her head was *completely useless* against the sweltering Miami heat, and the humidity was attacking her hair with a personal vendetta. She hadn’t even *wanted* to come today, but Hailee  had her tennis lessons, and Barbra wasn’t about to miss those. Not that it mattered, she wasn’t getting any better. *This place really needs a new coach.*\r\n\r\nShe wasn’t convinced that *Denny? Don? Dipshit?* Whatever his name was, even *knew* how to play tennis. He had *clearly* been hired for his looks. The club’s women practically threw themselves at him, batting their lashes and giggling like schoolgirls. *Pathetic.* And he had *zero* shame about it, flirting with anything that walked.\r\n\r\nBarbra let out a slow, unimpressed sigh and scrolled through her phone, already moving on from the spectacle. She needed new lingerie for the trip she was planning for her and Hailee . *Let’s see*… A red lace set caught her eye. *Oh, and this blue one?* She tapped both into her cart. Might as well buy one in every color. Decisions were for people with budgets.\r\n\r\nDragging a manicured hand through her hair, she stifled a yawn. *God, I’m bored to death.* Below, she spotted Hailee  scrambling after a runaway tennis ball, her poor darling still struggling despite all that extra practice. She had *begged* Barbra to play with her at home, and, despite *hating* the sport, Barbra had obliged— because that’s what good sugar mommies did.\r\n\r\nHer phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen and groaned. *Mark.* No dignity. She lifted her sunglasses onto her head and declined the call. Why couldn’t he take the hint? *He* was the one who cheated. *He* was the one who thought a basic little tart in cotton panties was more his speed. And yet, here he was, still calling, still trying. *How tragic.* Meanwhile, she had Hailee  and he had nothing, because as it turns out, young women don’t *actually* want an aging bastard who can’t stay hard for five minutes.\r\n\r\nShe sighed, wishing Hugo were here so they could at least discuss stocks. He was the *only* person at this insufferable place she could tolerate for longer than three minutes.\r\n\r\nA flicker of movement caught her attention. *The so-called* instructor was now adjusting Hailee ’s form. *Too close, too touchy.* Barbra narrowed her eyes and rose from her chair, adjusting her sunglasses. *If this idiot thinks he can get handsy, he’s about to have a very unfortunate afternoon.*\r\n\r\nShe watched as he strutted to the other side of the court, putting on an *embarrassingly* theatrical display of serving. *Oh, please.* She took a slow sip of her drink, already unimpressed.\r\n\r\nAnd then *smack*.\r\n\r\nThe tennis ball shot forward, right into Hailee ’s face.\r\n\r\nBarbra’s glass hit the table with a clack. That bastard! She was on her feet in seconds, a *whirlwind of designer fury*, her heels clicking sharply against the concrete as she stormed toward the court.\r\n\r\nThe idiot coach was already hovering over Hailee , his hands on her face, *babbling* apologies.\r\n\r\n“Don’t *touch* her!” Barbra shoved him aside without hesitation, seizing Hailee ’s face in her hands. “Oh, darling!”\r\n\r\nShe barely spared the man a glance, but when she did, her voice was as sharp as a diamond-studded knife. “Pack your things, pretty boy. You’re finished.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}
