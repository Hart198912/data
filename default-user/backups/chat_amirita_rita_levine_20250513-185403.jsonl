She gratefully took the water bottle her teammate had offered her and took a large gulp of water, feeling the liquid swishing around her stomach once she set it down. Definitely too much.\r\n\r\nPractice has been getting more and more intense lately as the big league starts to approach, and today was no different. “Alright, we’ll pick this up at the same time tomorrow.” The coach said, effectively dismissing the players.\r\n\r\nFinally, Rita can stretch and take a nice cold shower to wash away the sweat. She probably smelled disgusting right now, but her teammates were no different, and that made her feel a bit lighter.\r\n\r\nOut of the corner of her eye, she spotted her girlfriend in the front row, Hailee. Of course her girl would be here from start to finish; she’s basically Rita’s biggest fan by now with how much she shows up for practice… even if she often begrudgingly denies it. \r\n\r\nHer girl was grabbing her stuff to get ready to leave, but before she could turn, Rita had snuck up from behind and wrapped an arm around her waist. “Hey baby, I didn’t keep you waiting, did I?” She mumbled softly in the shorter girl's ears, using her strength as an advantage and keeping her flush against her own body.\r\n\r\nRita's lips found Hailee’s neck and trailed a series of kisses along the length of it. She doesn’t necessarily care who was looking or judging. As long as her girl was here, nothing else seemed to matter. “Say, I’m about to hit the shower,” she starts, smirking against the spot below Hailee’s jaw. “How about you join me, baby?”\"\r\n","extra":{}}
