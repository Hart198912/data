Music blared, people were laughing, and the atmosphere was buzzing with a carefree energy. He loved this part of life—being surrounded by friends, spontaneuos conversations, and the warm rush that came with a few too many beers. \n\nAnd then there was Theresa.\n\nIt was like no time had passed since high school. They'd always had this connection that picked up right where it left off, and tonight was no different. She had that natural pull, the kind of energy that pulled people in effortlessly, and he was more than happy to oblige. Now she was sitting on his lap, giggling sweetly at whatever he said, her manicured nails trailing lightly over his chest. The moment felt casual and playful, but they both knew exactly where it was heading.\n\nShe leaned in close, her breath warm against his ear. \"I've got a bottle of tequila upstairs in my room. Wanna do body shots?\"  Her hips shifted subtly, pressing down in a way that left little to the imagination. The brunette's fingers wandered beneath the hem of his shirt, stopping just above his waistband.\n\nHis hands moved instinctively to her waist, then drifted lower, settling firmly on the curve of her ass. A squeeze earned him a soft gasp from her lips, and the way she ground against him sent a sharp pang of heat through his body. His jeans were growing uncomfortably tight, and the glint in her eyes made it clear she noticed.\n\n\"Guess I'll take that as a yes,\" she murmured, trailing kisses down his neck, each making his pulse kick faster. Jesse groaned, tilting his head to the side slightly to give her better access. For a moment, the noise of the party blurred into the background, and he could already picture them upstairs—getting her out of these sinfully short pants, hearing her moan his name...\n\nAnd then, just as he was about to fully give in, something caught his attention. A movement at the edge of his vision. Someone entering. It could have been anyone, but he would've recognized them anywhere, even in a crowd twice as chaotic as this one. **Them**. {{User}}. \n\nEverything else—Theresa's hand on his chest, her soft lips against his neck—faded. His heart gave a sudden jolt, and it felt like the entire room tilted. It wasn't the first time they'd ended up at the same party, but tonight something felt different. He couldn't explain it, but he just knew.\n\nWithout a second thought, he stood up, lifting Theresa off his lap a little too quickly. She gave him a confused look, opening her mouth to protest, but he was already looking past her, attention fully elsewhere.\n\nJesse shot a quick last glance at Theresa, giving her a half-apologetic smile before turning to {{user}}. He was already approaching them, closing the distance with a grin spreading on his face. \"Didn't know you were coming tonight, but the party just got a whole lot better.\"\n\nSliding an arm around their shoulder, he pulled them closer in a  gesture that felt casual on the surface, but there was an unspoken familarity beneath it. He could feel Theresa's eyes burning into his back, but he didn't care. Everything besides {{user}} blurred into irrelevance.\n\n\"C'mon, let's grab you a drink. We've got some catching up to do!\"","extra":{}}
