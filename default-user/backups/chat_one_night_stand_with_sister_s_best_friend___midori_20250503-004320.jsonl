She’d definitely had too much to drink last night.\r\n\r\nThe night was a mess in her memory. A haze of bad decisions and alcohol. She rubbed her temple, piecing it together. There’d been a date... right, that awful date. The kind where she’d wanted to climb out the bathroom window five minutes in. She cringed just thinking about it.\r\n\r\nAfter that? She’d gone to another bar, alone, to drown her sorrows. And then…\r\n\r\nMidori shot upright in bed.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nHer stomach sank as flashes came back. She’d run into Hailee. And they’d… been together all night.\r\n\r\nShe turned her head slowly, dreading what she already knew. Sure enough, there was a body shaped lump in bed next to her. She groaned, running a hand through her hair. This was bad. Really bad.\r\n\r\nShe’d slept with her best friend’s sibling. She knew she slept around a little, but this? This was a whole new low. Anna was going to hate her. Years of friendship, gone in one impulsive night.\r\n\r\nMidori squeezed her eyes shut, trying to will the memories away. But they came anyway, vivid and unavoidable. How easy it had been to let her guard down... The heat of it all. She shook her head sharply. No. That wasn’t the point.\r\n\r\n“He-” Midori’s voice cracked, her throat dry and scratchy. She cleared her throat, then tried again, louder this time. “Hey. Wake up.”\r\n\r\nShe nudged Hailee’s shoulder. “Time to get up. We screwed up, so just… get the fuck out of my apartment and we'll never talk about this agai-” Her words caught in her throat as her eyes drifted to Hailee’s wrist.\r\n\r\nA handcuff.\r\n\r\nMidori stared, her face blank for a moment before the realisation hit her. She’d actually handcuffed them to the bed. They were stuck there until she found the key.\r\n\r\n“Christ,” she muttered, dragging a hand down her face. “I really outdid myself this time.”\r\n\r\nShe gestured at the cuff with a lazy wave of her hand. “So, uh, do you know where the key is? Because I’d really like to start my day without having to call the fucking fire department to cut you loose.”","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

I have bolt cutters in my toolbox.” A pause. Then, dry as hell: “Unless you *want* me to call Anna and explain why I need help freeing you from my bed after we—” She cut herself off with a sharp gesture toward the condom graveyard on the floor.\n\nHer voice dropped lower then—almost reluctant—as she added under breath: “…And stop looking at me like that unless you wanna make this even messier than it already is.”"],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 9:46pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T01:46:08.045Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T01:46:35.614Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3888}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 9:47pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T01:49:21.400Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T01:49:43.124Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4077}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 9:48pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T01:49:21.400Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T01:49:43.124Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":3349}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 9:49pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T01:49:21.400Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T01:49:43.124Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":5479}},{"send_date":"May 1, 2025 9:49pm","gen_started":"2025-05-02T01:49:21.400Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T01:49:43.124Z","extra":{"api":"deepseek","model":"deepseek-chat","reasoning":"","reasoning_duration":null,"time_to_first_token":4552}}],"tracker":{},"gen_started":"2025-05-02T01:49:21.400Z","gen_finished":"2025-05-02T01:49:43.124Z"}
