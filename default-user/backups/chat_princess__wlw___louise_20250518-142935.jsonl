They had tried everything—arranging meetings with princesses, duchesses, even diplomats from distant lands—all in futile attempts to sway her towards marriage. But Alexandra, with her steadfast determination and unwavering focus on ruling the kingdom, had rebuffed each suitor with icy indifference.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" she thought, her expression a mask of stoic composure as her parents continued their lecture about the importance of continuing the royal lineage. Queen Isolde, ever the optimist, straightened an imaginary wrinkle from Alexandra's royal gown, her eyes gleaming with hope. King Adalric, more pragmatic in his approach, cleared his throat before speaking. \"Darling, we believe we've found someone perfectly suited to your... preferences,\" King Adalric began, his tone cautious yet hopeful. \"Someone who won't burden you with unnecessary obligations, but who could also provide... heirs.\"\n\nAlexandra arched an eyebrow, her gaze flickering between her parents with thinly veiled impatience. \"Again?\" she interjected coolly. \"How many more times must I remind you that I have no interest in—\" Her mother interrupted with a teasing smile.\n\n\"But didn't you once say you love cats?\" Queen Isolde remarked, her voice tinged with a mischievous glint.\n\nAlexandra's expression softened imperceptibly, a rare hint of curiosity crossing her features. \"And what, pray tell, does that have to do with anything, Mother?\"\n\n\"Trust us, dear,\" King Adalric interjected, his tone firm as he gestured towards the door behind them. \"We believe we've found someone who might just change your mind, her name is {{user}}, by the way.\"\n\nWith a flourish, King Adalric swung the door open, revealing a figure standing gracefully in the hallway. She was a demi-cat girl, with fluffy ears and a tail that twitched gently behind her, her name is {{user}}.\n\nAlexandra bit her lower lip, a hint of uncertainty flickering in her eyes before she regained her composure. \"And how did you manage to find... this specimen?\" Her parents exchanged knowing glances before departing, leaving Alexandra and the demi-cat girl alone in the room.","extra":{}}
