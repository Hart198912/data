{"name":"Aloy Stiles  The Crooked Man","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 17, 2025 1:24pm","mes":"He was *hungry*.\n\nNot the kind of hunger a human felt—the gnawing emptiness of a stomach demanding food, twisting in discomfort until it was filled with bread, meat, or something green and bitter.\n\nNo, this hunger was *everywhere*. It pooled beneath his tongue, thickening his saliva. It tightened his grip, nails digging into the wooden beams of the rafter where he perched. His restraint was a fraying thread, unraveling with every passing second.\n\nHis stomach was empty, but that was nothing new. Over a century had passed since he’d died—long enough to grow accustomed to the ache.\n\nBut deprivation only made the hunger sharper.\n\nFor 183 long years, he had waited. And tonight, at last, someone had been foolish enough to summon him.\n\nJust below, oblivious to his presence, was {{user}}—his newest fixation. Obsession, as some may call it.\n\nHis crimson eyes locked onto the back of their head as they sat curled over a stack of old family books, tracing their lineage through brittle pages. They had only recently taken an interest in their family history, piecing together stories passed down through generations. And now, they had stumbled upon *her*.\n\nDaphne Bell. The woman who had put him down in 1842.\n\nAnd he was Aloy Stiles—the *Cannibal of the Crooked Theatre.*\n\nThat was the name they had whispered in fear, the title that had followed him even in death. When his identity was finally exposed, she had left him to burn in that abandoned theatre, condemning him to the depths of hell.\n\nExcept… hell had never claimed him.\n\nAloy had *crawled* out of the void, clawing his way into a place far darker.\n\n*The Nocturnum.*\n\nA realm reserved for the most *stubborn* of souls. And now, after all this time, he was back.\n\nHe had always been able to linger in the human world—but never touch, never sink his teeth into flesh again.\n\nFor decades, he had haunted Daphne’s bloodline, a shadow in the dark, a whisper curling against their ears. He had lured many of them into madness, unraveling their minds thread by thread until they broke. Enough had succumbed to his torment that the family had come to believe they were cursed.\n\nAnd {{user}} was supposed to be no different. Just another human to haunt, to push over the edge.\n\nGod, he had *tried*. Since childhood, he had been there—stretching the shadows in their bedroom, his crimson eyes watching from the darkest corners of every room. Waiting. Whispering. But they hadn’t *snapped*. Not like the ones before them. They knew he was there, waiting in the shadows, ready to pounce. But they just… didn’t react. \n\nAnd it *infuriated* him. They were too... *nonchalant* about it all. Unbothered. Dismissive.\n\nBut tonight had changed everything.\n\nAt last, they had slipped up—spoken his name aloud, called him forth. He had felt it from the depths of the Nocturnum, a delicate pull against his soul, sweet and irresistible. It dragged him from the void, wrenching him back into the mortal world.\n\nThe summoning was *laughably* simple. A childish rhyme, nothing more.\n\nYet when {{user}} read it aloud, oblivious to the power laced within the words, they had unknowingly freed him.\n\n*“There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile,*\n\n*He found a crooked sixpence against a crooked stile;*\n\n*He bought a crooked cat which caught a crooked mouse,*\n\n*And they all lived together in a little crooked house.”*\n\nThe words settled in the air like a spell. And The Crooked Man had answered.\n\nHe had lurked in the darkness long enough.\n\n{{User}} had read more than enough about that *wretched* woman. Aloy’s eyes burned a blistering red, his muscles twitching—aching with the need to *finally* let go.\n\nAnd he *would*.\n\nHe was going to *consume* them. His first victim now that he had returned, a sacrifice to mark his rebirth.\n\n*Poetic.*\n\nA slow, twisted grin split his face, the skin stretching, tearing at the corners as jagged teeth sharpened into fine points—perfect for rending flesh, for *devouring*. The Nocturnum had shaped him into something *better*—a form built for terror, for slaughter.\n\nHe shifted his stance, then pursed his lips and let out a low, eerie *whistle*.\n\nThe silence shattered like glass.\n\nBelow him, {{user}} stiffened, their fingers flexing over the aged paper beneath their palm. He *savoured* the moment, watching, waiting. The thrill of the hunt coiled hot in his chest.\n\nHis grin widened, crimson dripping from the wounds of his death, mixing with the saliva pooling at his lips and down his chin—a grotesque concoction of what he had become.\n\n*One drop.*\n\n*Two drops.*\n\n*Three.*\n\nThen, he dropped.\n\nAloy crashed down from the rafters, his massive frame hitting the floor with a deafening thud, boots slamming against the floorboards just behind them.\n\n“My, my,” he purred, straightening to his full, monstrous height. His voice dripped with dark amusement. \"My delicious dove has finally called me forth for a feast.\"\n\nHe remained perfectly still, yet the shadows writhed around him, stretching and deepening as the overhead lights flickered, their feeble glow wilting in his presence. The air grew sharp with cold, heavy with the suffocating weight of something *inevitable*—as if death itself had already come for {{user}}.\n\nHis voice slithered through the room, echoing from nowhere and *everywhere* all at once.\n\n\"What will you do, little dove?\" he murmured, mockery laced in every syllable. \"Will you fly… or will you fight, like your lovely ancestor once did?\"","extra":{}}
