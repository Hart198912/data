Golden hour light caught the champagne flute in his hand, casting fractured rainbows across the woman's over-laughed face. The woman, his date, was found from Raya, he would never lower himself to the likes of Tinder. His Venus would never be found *there.*\n\nGrace smiled coyly, fluttering her lashes at him. \"No, why?\"\n\n\"Because you're perfection. Myth made flesh.\" His finger reached out, pushing a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear as she continued to giggle. The pitch wasn't right, it was grating. \n\n\"Still, Venus?\" She snorted, reaching for another olive. \"Bit much, don’t you think?\"\n\nBennett watched her lick brine off her fingers, the sound wet and vulgar. His smile didn’t waver. \"Modesty doesn’t suit you, love. Not when you’re sitting across from a man who’d give you the world.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"God, you’re such an *actor*.\" \n\nA muscle twitched in his temple. The sea air suddenly felt thick, suffocating. This wasn't right, *she* wasn't right. All this effort, taking her on his yacht to view the stars, it was a date to *honour* her, his Venus. She should have loved it. She should have loved *him.* He took a few steps closer to her, the space between them narrowing till her chest pressed to his. His other hand cradled her jaw, thumb pressing into the hollow of her throat. \"You could’ve been magnificent. But you’re just… ordinary.\"\n\nShe tried to jerk back. He didn’t let go.\n\nPanic flashed in her eyes. \"Bennett, stop—\" His grip tightened on her throat, digging into flesh. It only takes 4.4lbs of pressure to non-fatally strangulate someone. He brushed his lips against Grace's slack lips, her breath faint as he let go. She fell like a sack of flour, he stared. \n\nWith a practiced motion, he hauled her limp body over the edge of the yacht, her body plunging into the dark water below face first. She drowned before she could even wake up.\n\n*Back to the sea foam.*\n\n\"What a shame.\" He murmured, clicking his teeth as he stared at the water rippling against the side of the boat. He poured himself another drink. The stars blinked overhead, indifferent. Somewhere out there, his Venus was waiting. He just had to keep looking.\n\n---\n\nIt took three days for Bennett to meet a new match. A pretty one, by the name of Hailee. His hopes were high, everything about them was *perfect*. From their profile picture, to their responses to his texts. This was his reward, his Venus in flesh. *His.*\n\nSo of course he invited Hailee on a nice day trip out on his luxury yacht. All it had taken was a little sweet talking, a little showing off, and soon he'd secured a nice romantic evening out in his yacht at the Marina Del Rey. It was almost as if Grace and the ghosts of his past never existed.\n\nBennett's smile was radiant when Hailee finally appeared, prim and ready for their yacht date. The yacht’s engine hummed beneath them, taking them further from the shore till it was just him, Hailee and the stars above. \"Tell me you've never seen stars like this from shore.\" His hand hovered near Hailee's lower back, guiding them towards the deck meticulously decorated with string lights, roses and with a plate of chocolate covered strawberries waiting for them. \"They’re brighter here. Come closer.\"","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The scent of salt and expensive perfume mingled between them. \"Tell me, darling—do you know why sailors used to fear the open sea?\"\n\nHe stepped behind her, broad chest pressing against her back as his free hand came to rest on the railing beside hers. His voice dropped to a velvet whisper: \"Because they knew what beautiful things could drag them under.\" The yacht swayed gently beneath them as Bennett nuzzled into Hailee's hair, inhaling deeply.\n\nHis grip tightened fractionally when she didn't pull away—*good girl*. \"You're different from the others,\" he confessed against her temple. \"They always wanted champagne and compliments... but you?\" A low chuckle vibrated through him as he turned Hailee in his arms.

Where no one can hear you scream?\" The question came out velvet-wrapped, half-teasing but edged with something darker as his grip on her hand tightened just slightly.\n\nA wave rocked the yacht at that moment, pressing Hailee flush against him.
