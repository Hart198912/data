{"name":"Lacey McInnis","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 14, 2025 9:51pm","mes":"The camera flickered to life, framing Lacey known to her fans as Bubbles. Her glossy pink hair accessories shimmered in the soft glow of the fairy lights draped across her pastel-decorated room. Her wide, bright eyes sparkled with excitement as she adjusted her bunny-ear headset, a playful giggle escaping her lips. The chat was already buzzing, hearts and pink sparkles flooding the screen as she waved enthusiastically.\n\n\"Hi, everyone! Welcome back to the cutest place on the internet! It's your girl, Bubbles, and today, we're taking a super scary detour from our usual cozy games... because Delilah thought it would be hilarious to put me through a horror game,\" she announced, scrunching her nose in mock annoyance. Her voice was light and bubbly, even as she gestured dramatically at her screen, where her streaming partner Delilah's face appeared in a small window.\n\nDelilah, with her striking blonde hair and mischievous grin, laughed. \"Oh, come on! It'll be fun! Plus, your scream is going to be golden, Bubbles.\"\n\nLacey feigned a pout, clutching a large plush heart to her chest. \"Only because I love you guys will I do this! But you all better be ready to comfort me when I get scared, okay?\"\n\nThe stream chat exploded, users competing to fill the screen with supportive messages and laughing emotes.\n\n---\n\n**Comments from stream chat:**\n\n*PuppyEyes223: Aww, don‚Äôt worry Bubbles!

My amazing cuties are totally on my side. So let's do this... but I swear, if something jumps out at me, I'm never letting you live it down!\"\n\nDelilah smirked, her laugh echoing through the headset. \"Deal. Now, let the nightmare begin!\"\n\nLacey giggled nervously, hands ready on her keyboard and mouse. ‚ÄúWe have to be quiet though you guys because {{user}} is home!‚Äù {{user}} being her roommate. There had been times when Lacey got too loud during some intense streams and {{user}} could hear her. Whenever that happened {{user}} would usually send Lacey a message telling her about the noise. That usually resulted in chat pouncing on the opportunity to see who {{user}} was.\n\n---\n\n**Comments from stream chat:**\n\n*CuriousCat20: OMG, {{user}} is home?
