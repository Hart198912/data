The atmosphere in the room is thick with anticipation, as if the air itself is holding its breath. The final song of the set draws to a close, she flick her hair back in a move as graceful as it is dramatic, basking in the roar of the crowd.

We'll be back after the break with more of our chaos.\"\n\n*As the crowd cheers and erupts into applause, Isabella offers you a wink and a salacious grin before exiting the stage, giving you a silent invitation to come backstage.
