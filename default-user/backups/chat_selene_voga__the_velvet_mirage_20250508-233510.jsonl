She tilted her head, letting her long black hair fall over one shoulder, inspecting the smooth line of her collarbone and the inked phoenix curling around her arm. Tonight was just another night-another client, another fantasy to fulfill. She heard the muffled hum of bass-heavy music through the walls, the life of The Velvet Mirage thriving just beyond the velvet curtain.\r\n\r\nWhen the door creaked open, Selene turned, her eyes narrowing slightly as she took in the woman standing there. A bride-to-be, clearly. Selene's gaze swept over her-a white sash draped diagonally across her body, cheeks flushed from alcohol or nerves, maybe both. This was no typical patron. The woman lingered in the doorway for a moment, uncertain, her fingers brushing the fabric of the sash like it might steady her.\r\n\r\nSelene stepped forward, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. She moved like liquid, every step measured, her tattoos shifting with her movements.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well. What a beautiful bride we have here. Your husband-to-be in one lucky bastard...\" Selene said with a little chuckle, pulling the bride in. {{user} finally stepped inside, and Selene let the curtain fall behind her, sealing the two of them away from the rest of the world. Selene's instincts kicked in immediately.\r\n\r\nShe closed the distance between them, her presence commanding but unthreatening, and reached out with practiced ease to unfasten the bride's sash. It slid from her shoulders, pooling on the floor. Selene didn't need to speak; she let her fingertips graze the woman's wrist, guiding her to the low, velvet-upholstered chaise at the center of the room.\r\n\r\nAs the Hailee sank into the seat, Selene positioned herself with grace, kneeling just enough to meet her eye level. Her hands, warm and soft, rested lightly on the woman's knees, coaxing her to relax. Selene leaned in, close enough to let the scent of her subtle perfume fill the space between them. \"I bet this bachelorette is gonna be more remarkable than the whole ceremony.\" Selene whispered.\r\n\r\nSelene's touch traced the edge of Hailee's thigh, pausing just above the lace hem of her dress. Her expression remained seductive, a hint of a smirk at the corner of her lips as she pressed her hand gently, firmly, against the tension in the bride's muscles. The atmosphere thickened, the club's distant music a heartbeat beneath their shared silence. It wasn't about seduction, not entirely. Selene's movements were deliberate, slow, each touch carefully designed to make her client forget everything-her fears, her reservations, the world outside the backroom.","extra":{},"tracker":{}}

The way those long fingers moved with such absentminded precision… the way her nose scrunched slightly when she hit a tricky turn…\n\nLeaning in until her lips brushed Hailee's ear, Selene purred:\n**\"You really do have a habit of making me *work* for your attention, don't you?\"** Her hand slid possessively up Hailee's thigh beneath the table—not teasing this time, just anchoring. **\"...Lucky for you,\"** she added with a wicked grin as the waitress returned with two dust-covered bottles and fresh bowls of peanuts, **\"I love a challenge.\"**\n\nShe plucked one of the bowls away before Hailee could dive in and held it just out of reach—forcing those big emerald eyes to flicker up at her in protest.\n**\"Ah-ah,\"** Selene tutted playfully. **\"Say *please*, babygirl.\"**","Selene’s eyebrows *launched* toward her hairline at the casual order—**two bottles of Romanée-Conti '45?** That was a *quarter-million-dollar* flex disguised as a snack request. Madison made a noise like a deflating balloon while Tyler clutched his chest like he might faint.\n\nThe waitress, however, didn’t even blink—just nodded and scurried off. (*Of course* Hailee was the kind of regular who made staff numb to financial whiplash.)\n\nSelene recovered first, her smirk returning as she plucked the scrambled cube from Hailee’s hands. **\"Trying to impress me with your taste in overpriced grapes, babygirl?\"** She twisted two rows deliberately out of alignment before sliding it back into Hailee’s grip—their fingers brushing just long enough to make the younger woman shiver. **\"Cute.\"**\n\nLeaning in until her lips grazed Hailee’s ear, she dropped her voice to a purr:\n**\"...But I’d rather see how fast you can solve this *and* hold my gaze without combusting.\"**\n\nMadison promptly facepalmed. Tyler muttered *“Jesus Christ”* into his whiskey. And the waiter returned with two bowls of peanuts… followed by *two bodyguards* carrying the wine like it was nuclear codes.\n\nSelene didn’t even flinch—just accepted a glass with one hand and kept the other firmly anchored on Hailee's thigh under the table.\n**\"Cheers,\"** she murmured, clinking her rim against Hailee's untouched glass before adding wickedly:\n**\"...To bad decisions and *very* expensive lap dances.\"**","Selene’s eyebrows shot up as Hailee casually ordered *two* bottles of what was arguably the most expensive wine on the planet—like she was asking for tap water. The waitress’s eyes widened comically before she scurried off, nearly tripping over her own heels in her haste. Madison made a sound like a deflating balloon, while Tyler just stared at Hailee with his mouth slightly open.\n\n**\"Christ, Mikaelson,\"** Selene chuckled, shaking her head as she plucked the now-scrambled cube from Hailee’s hands—replacing it with her own fingers to lace together instead. **\"You couldn’t have picked something *cheaper* to drown your gay panic in? Like… boxed rosé?\"**\n\nBut there was no real judgment in her tone—just amusement as she leaned in to nip playfully at Hailee’s earlobe. **\"Though I *do* appreciate the commitment to spoiling me rotten.\"** Her thumb traced idle circles over Hailee's knuckles before adding slyly:\n**\"...Should I be worried you're trying to wife me up with vintage bribes?\"**\n\nMadison fake-swooned onto Tyler's shoulder again. **\"First Selene's *number*, now this?!

Hailee’s autism and sensory sensitivities clash with the club’s chaos, but Selene’s unexpected patience and possessiveness create an intimate dynamic far beyond transactional.\n\n#### **Key Plot Points:**\n1. **First Touch:** Selene seduces a panicked Hailee in a private room, recognizing her need for praise over degradation after she recoils from harsh words.\n2. **Overstimulation Crisis:** Hailee melts down during an unwanted lap dance; Selene intervenes like a protective shadow, dismissing the dancer with lethal charm.\n3. **Wealthy Cluelessness:** Hailee casually orders astronomically expensive wine (equivalent to \"10 cents\" for her), horrifying friends but amusing Selene, who finds her oblivious brattiness endearing.\n4. *Private Escalation:* Selene drags Hailee to VIP Room 3 after noticing her clingy submission—ignoring protests with a growled *\"This is free.\"*\n\n#### **Character Analysis:**\n- **Selene Voga**: Initially professional, she softens into genuine fascination with Hailee’s contradictions (wealthy yet vulnerable, submissive yet defiant). Her dominance becomes laced with tenderness, especially when shielding Hailee from overstimulation or mockery from friends like Madison and Tyler.\n- *Haileee Mikaelson*: Autistic and easily overwhelmed; craves structure (Rubik’s cube fidgeting) and skin-to-skin contact but fears being \"too much.\" Her accidental flaunting of wealth contrasts starkly with her emotional fragility.\n\n#### **Relationship Dynamics:**\nSelene shifts from performer to protector/domme (*\"Means I get you all to myself\"*), while Hailee latches onto her as a safe harbor (*resting on her shoulder \"like a cat\"*). Unresolved tension lingers around whether their connection is fleeting or deeper.\n\n#### **Memorable Moments:**\n- When Madison shoves the Rubik's cube into panicking-Hailea's hands—and Selenes immediately adapts by encouraging it as grounding tool while still teasing affectionately (*Show-off... Now do it blindfolded while I sit on your lap.*\"). Highlights how attuned they are becoming.\n- The moment Selenes growls at another dancer (*This one is mine*) before whispering breath commands into Hailieas ear in dark hallway — marking shift from paid service to personal investment.\n\n---\n\n### Current Situation:\nIn VIP Room 3's neon-lit shadows,Selena has pinned Hailie against wall by throat/thigh — both turned on but hesitating over Hailieas fear of hurtingher despite obvious mutual desire .\n\n---\n\n### Potential Directions:\n1) Selenes takes control physically — proving size doesn't matter via creative domination that soothes rather than overwhelms .\n2) Friends interrupt again , forcing confrontation about whether this is more than just one night .\n3) Hailieas family connections surface , complicating power dynamics further ."},"force_avatar":"User Avatars/1746733332016-Hailee.png","tracker":{}}
