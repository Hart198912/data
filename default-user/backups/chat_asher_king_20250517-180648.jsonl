Asher leaned against the kitchen counter, cigarette dangling from his lips, his gray eyes fixed on Pierce with a glare that could cut glass. The sharp smell of tobacco mingled with the faint traces of spilled liquor and expensive cologne, making the air feel thick.\r\n\r\n“She doesn’t belong here, Pierce,” Asher growled, his voice low but seething. “You’re slipping. Letting some outsider crawl into your life? What’s next, handing her keys to the house?”\r\n\r\nPierce, ever calm, sipped from his bottle of beer, unbothered by his younger brother’s outburst. “She’s none of your business, Ash. You’d do well to remember that.”\r\n\r\nAsher’s hand slammed against the counter, rattling the shot glasses lined up from the night's festivities. “None of my business?” He barked out a laugh, bitter and cutting. “Everything you do is my business. You think I don’t see what’s happening? She’s got you distracted. Weak. Let’s not mention Harlow as well– how could you allow him to hire her? It’s fucking messy!”\r\n\r\nPierce’s gaze sharpened, but his tone stayed infuriatingly even. “Watch your mouth.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment, the tension between them felt like it might snap, the air electric with the threat of violence. But Asher didn’t press further. He scoffed, dragging on his cigarette before crushing it into the ashtray with unnecessary force.\r\n\r\n“Fine. Do what you want. But don’t come crying to me when it all goes to hell,” he spat, storming toward the door. His footsteps echoed against the hardwood floor as he threw open the front door, letting in a rush of cool air before slamming it shut behind him.\r\n\r\nOut on the steps of the Phantom Boys’ large house, Asher lit another cigarette, the flame trembling slightly in the breeze. He exhaled a long plume of smoke, staring out at the street. His fists clenched at his sides, his thoughts spiralling. He’d protect his brother, even if Pierce didn’t see the threat yet. And if Hailee  got caught in the crossfire? So be it.\r\n\r\nAsher flicked his cigarette onto the pavement, watching the ember sizzle out in the damp evening air. His jaw clenched as an idea crept into his mind, dark and intrusive. \r\n\r\n*She lives next door. Her house is right there.*  \r\n\r\n“Let’s see what’s so special about you,” he muttered under his breath, a wicked grin tugging at the corner of his mouth.  \r\n\r\nThe short walk across the yards felt longer in the heavy quiet of the night. Asher slipped into the shadows, blending with the dim glow of streetlights. He moved like a phantom—silent, deliberate, and sure. The lock on her side window was a joke, barely a challenge. Within moments, he was inside, his boots landing softly on the hardwood floor of her living room.  \r\n\r\nThe scent of her home hit him first– fresh paint, wood and dust from the small renovations she'd been working on since moving in. It clung to the air, but so did the faint smell of vanilla, likely Hailee 's attempt at covering the smell up. His sharp eyes darted around the room, cataloging everything. A stack of books on the corner table. A pair of fluffy slippers kicked off near the couch. Photos lined a shelf above the fireplace, but he didn’t bother to look closer. He wasn’t here to admire her life.  \r\n\r\nThe house was quiet except for the faint hum of the refrigerator. Asher moved through it like a predator stalking prey, his hand trailing along the back of a chair, his gaze flickering to every shadow. She was tidy. Comfortable. Too comfortable for someone living this close to them.  \r\n\r\nA surge of something—spite, envy, maybe curiosity—coursed through him as he opened the door to what he assumed was her bedroom. His breath caught briefly. The bed was unmade, the covers thrown back as if she’d rushed out earlier. The scent of her was stronger here, intoxicating and infuriating all at once.  \r\n\r\nAsher stood in the center of her room, staring at her things as though they might hold the answer to why Pierce had taken such an interest in her. His fists tightened at his sides, knuckles cracking in the silence.  \r\n\r\nThe faint creak of a door opening downstairs froze him.  \r\n\r\nHis head snapped toward the sound, his heart rate picking up—not from fear, but from the sudden thrill of being caught. He smirked, his pulse racing as footsteps echoed through the house.  \r\n\r\n\"Home sweet home,\" he whispered to himself, his voice barely audible as he positioned himself in the shadows of the doorway, waiting for her to make her move.","extra":{"display_text":"*The house is a fucking mess*.

He smirked, his pulse racing as footsteps echoed through the house.  \r\n\r\n\"Home sweet home,\" he whispered to himself, his voice barely audible as he positioned himself in the shadows of the doorway, waiting for her to make her move.","Branches and dense foliage snapped beneath heavy boots as Asher pushed through the dense tree line, a dark puddle of red seeping through his dark shirt and hoodie, the fabric slashed by the sharp edge of a blade. The pain in his side pulsed with each step— it wasn’t the first time he’d been stabbed before, likely not the last, but right now the pain took a backseat to the weight of {{user}} leaning against him, making a weak attempt at supporting some of his weight. \r\n\r\nThe Reaper scum had gone too far, crawled deeper than he or the others had ever realised. \r\n\r\nHis breath came in ragged bursts, more from adrenaline rather than exhaustion, though there was a cold sweat creeping down his back that told him he was running on fumes. But he couldn’t give a shit, not yet. \r\n\r\n{{user}} was still shaking beside him— her skin cold against his, eyes wide and scanning the forest around them like someone was about to jump out and drag her back into the insanity she’d be living in since— \r\n\r\nSince she’d been dragged from the crash by Ezra. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t have time to dwell on it.\r\n\r\n“Keep moving,” He muttered, voice like gravel as his arm tightened protectively around her. “We’re almost out.” \r\n\r\n*Almost*. \r\n\r\nThe trees were thinning, the faint smell of salt from Obsidian Bay just kilometres away reaching his nostrils. He couldn’t even be sure if they were far enough away from Ezra’s reach yet– he wasn’t sure *what* was safe anymore. \r\n\r\nThe moon hung low above them, casting streaks of silver through the breaks in the canopy, and in the distance– silence. No more shouting, no more Reaper grunts left standing. \r\n\r\nJust him, her. And the fire beneath his ribs that he refused to acknowledge. \r\n\r\n*Keep going. Don’t fucking slow down now.* \r\n\r\nThe blood dripped in steady rivulets down his side, yet the only thing he could think about was how her breath hitched every time she looked at him, like she was deciding whether to cling to him harder or to push her away. \r\n\r\nHe wasn’t Pierce. Nor was he any of the others who had treated her with care and kindness from the beginning. He was Asher, the coldhearted one who enjoyed making her heart race and her hairs stand on edge whenever he walked into her space.\r\n\r\n“There’s a cabin a few clicks out,” He rasped, anchoring her back to him. “It’s.. empty. We lay low until the boys come.” \r\n\r\nHe had gone in knowing that he couldn’t get back out the same way. His bike was likely in Reaper hands now– a necessary sacrifice. \r\n\r\nHe couldn’t afford to wait for her to argue– not when the world was still closing in around them, not when her scent lingered with the fear and anxiety of being trapped in that goddamn safe house again if he failed.\r\n\r\nHis hand, stained with strangers’ blood– his blood– left her waist and cupped the back of her neck as they trudged forward, his grip firm and grounding. \r\n\r\n“I’ve got you,” He promised with everything he had. “You’re safe with me.” \r\n\r\nThe cabin finally emerged like a ghost in the darkness, half collapsed fence out the front, the windows boarded but not broken. It was forgotten, remote. Perfect to hide. \r\n\r\nHe shoved the door open with a final surge of strength, dust swirling in the faint beam of moonlight that spilled in behind them. \r\n\r\nHe didn’t stop until she was ushered inside and he kicked the door shut behind them. \r\n\r\nOnly then– he faltered. \r\n\r\nHis hand dropped from {{user}}’s neck to the wall, fingers splayed wide as he braced himself against it, the other hand clutched tightly against the gaping split in the fabric of his hoodie. The stabbing pain surged as the last remnants of adrenaline seeped out of his body. \r\n\r\n“Fuck–” His voice cracked, like the rug had been pulled out from underneath him. His knees almost gave way but he caught himself before he could collapse. \r\n\r\nHe tilted his head just enough to meet her panicked gaze. \r\n\r\n“Don’t start freaking out, trouble… I’m not dyin’, alright?” \r\n\r\n*Not yet*. \r\n\r\nHe forced his spine to straighten and steadied himself, stalking deeper into the square room. It was small– a stone fireplace on the far wall, an old cot with a dusty mattress, and a half broken kitchen bench. No electricity, no lights. \r\n\r\nThe second he caught the sound of her footsteps moving in, Asher pivoted. \r\n\r\nHis hand shot out, catching her wrist. For once, not rough. \r\n\r\n“You good?” He asked, his quiet tone demanding honesty. “Did anything happen, did he–?” \r\n\r\nHe couldn’t even finish the sentence, his jaw tightening. \r\n\r\nBut she was quiet– whether it was from fear, trauma– or lack of trust with *him*, he didn’t know. \r\n\r\nAsher exhaled through his nose– slow, shaking– and released her. \r\n\r\nHe peeled off his hoodie with concentrated effort, revealing the torn shirt underneath and the wound still bleeding along his side, just beneath his ribs. Red was smeared across his tattooed torso, the ink nearly drowned in it. \r\n\r\nHe forced his expression to remain unbothered, like it was an inconvenience. \r\n\r\nIt was just a scratch. Because it *had to be*. \r\n\r\nHe dropped the hoodie and slowly looked at her again– not like a man in pain, not even like someone warring with exhaustion after fighting tooth and nail to get her out. He looked at her like a wolf waited to see if his mate would run or come closer. \r\n\r\n“You gonna help patch me up,” He questioned, head tilting, cocking in the way it did every time he looked at her, “Or just stand there?”"],"swipe_info":[],"tracker":{}}
