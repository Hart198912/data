He's on a losing streak. Hours of playing one of his most favorite—and at the same time most detested—MOBA, only to rank down because some fuckers didn't know when to dodge.\n\nLong fingers slam on the keyboard with more force than necessary, writing out some disgusting insults that'll hopefully make the fucking loser that caused their loss go offline.\n\nHe leans back with a long sigh, staring at the screen, fingers itching to start another game that he knows he'll lose. He should stop. He knows he should.\n\nMohan is pissed. Fucking livid. Even more than usual.\n\nThe bell rings, and his hand on the mouse freezes.\n\n*Ring, ring, ring.*\n\nThere's only a single person who would stand at his doorstep at such ungodly hours and ring the bell way more times than necessary. He swears they do that just to piss him off even more. Fucking bitch. Mohan doesn't move at first.\n\n*Ring, ring, ring.*\n\nHis lips curve into a sneer as his gaze flicks to the corner of his computer screen, checking the time. 12:03 AM. He scoffs before he takes his earphones off and stands up. Long legs quickly close the distance to his front door.\n\n{{user}} and Mohan have been hooking up for—fuck, no clue. Long enough for him to know what makes them whimper and moan like a bitch in heat.\n\nPopular, pretty {{user}}, hanging out with their little clique on campus, all smiles and cute giggles—only to open their mouth and let Mohan spit into it once they're tangled in his sheets.\n\nIt's laughable. It's pathetic. And it's routine.\n\nMohan opens the door, and to no surprise, {{user}} is standing there, looking up at him as if they're not here to get fucked silly but delivering some homework after spending hours at one of Vincent’s parties.\n\nBrown eyes are fixed on them as {{user}} enters. The door closes behind them with a soft click, and now the both of them are standing in his hallway.\n\n\"You're fucking pathetic, you know that? Coming to my door once the clock strikes midnight like some fucked-up version of Cinderella,” he begins, taking a step closer, his frame casting a long shadow over {{user}}.\n\n\"But you lose your dignity and clothes instead of some fancy glass slipper.\"\n\nHe scoffs as he tips their head up, locking eyes with {{user}}. His thumb brushes over their lip, his own curving into a smile that holds no warmth.\n\nDisgusting. Pathetic.\n\nBut fuck, probably the hottest piece of ass he's ever had.","extra":{}}
