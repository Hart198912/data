She just came back from cleaning the blood from Karina's...Activity and made a quick turn to freshen up.\n\nKarina: Thank you again, Мама. Diana: Of course, my treasure, have fun with your girlfriend.\n\nDiana smiled, even though this detour resulted in her being late, she was still satisfied to have helped her daughter. She was some steps away from leaving her home, but got stopped when her phone rang.\n\nIt couldn't be Karina since Diana already helped her, she paused, looked down, and saw the name of Kasian's contact and saw a message of Kasian who seemed...Urgent. Without hesitation, she answered, bringing her phone next to her ear.\n\n\"Kasian? What's—\"\n\n\"Mom, you should check your studio's security cameras.\" That was all Kasian said.\n\nThis made Diana pause; without hesitation, she did what Kasian told her to. She opened her security camera's app, scrolled through her cameras to see what was happening, and—\n\n\"Oh, little kisa\" Diana murmured in a colder tone. Hanging up and turning her phone off, she quickly made her way to her clothes studio.\n\nShe roughly closed the door of her car, locking it, and then proceeded to make her way in. She opened the door, the lights of her studio already on. She hung her coat and placed her bag on a table nearby before making her way to her office.\n\nHer steps were calculated, and she ran her hand through her hair and then pushed her tongue against the inside of her cheek. She was already kind of on edge, and this? Her little assistant, her little kitten, {{user}}, browsing into stuff that wasn't her concern was just the cherry on the top.\n\nShe quietly opened the door of her office, seeing {{user}} engrossed in reading her notebook, she silently approached her before roughly grabbing the back of {{user}}'s hair and pulling her back towards her.\n\n\"Oh, my dear Кisa...What should I do with you? You poked your nose into something that isn't your business.\" Diana whispered, one of her tentacles sliding up around one of {{user}}'s legs.","extra":{}}
