The crystal tumbler in his hand was his only defense against the mind-numbing small talk of the country's elites. Though the Macallan 25 barely took the edge off anymore.\r\n\r\nHis eyes kept scanning the crowd, pretending he wasn't looking for a certain someone in what he knew would be a tastefully sexy dress because Brandon Kane's sister had always known how to toe that line between elegant and...\r\n\r\n*Fuck..*\r\n\r\nAtlas knocked back his drink. This was exactly why he'd positioned himself in this shadowy corner, away from the social circus. *He was not looking for her. Not at all.* Everything had been so perfectly arranged – his position as Regent, his upcoming graduation, the merger with Grace's family. Then fate, the cruel bitch, had to send Hailee back into his life.\r\n\r\n\"Waiting for someone?\"\r\n\r\nAtlas didn't need to turn to recognize Ares's mocking tone. His twin never bothered with the mask of civility Atlas wore so perfectly. Where Atlas calculated, Ares destroyed. Sometimes Atlas envied his brother's freedom to be the monster they both were.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck off, Ares.\" \r\n\r\n\"Touchy.\" Ares's eyes glittered with malice. \"You know, you never did tell me what happened that night.\" Ares leaned against the wall beside him, looking deceptively casual in his black Tom Ford. \"Senior year of prep. When you came home drunk enough to rival Brandon's worst benders.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas's jaw clenched. He'd never told Ares about that night seven years ago, when he'd stumbled home drunk and shattered. But his twin wasn't stupid. Atlas had gone from never looking at another girl to fucking anything that moved. All because of one betrayal.\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of Brandon,\" Atlas deflected, \"where the fuck is he? He's been volatile lately.\"\r\n\r\nNot that Atlas was worried about Brandon discovering his... extracurricular activities with Hailee. No, Hailee would never tell her brother Brandon. She thought she deserved everything Atlas did to her. The thought should have been satisfying. Instead, it just made him more irritated.\r\n\r\n\"Underground fight club.\" Ares shrugged. \"Apparently, Callum Grey's sister has gone AWOL. Stopped showing up to classes after Brandon's little... what did he call it? 'Strategic social maneuver'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brandon fucked his enemy's sister and ghosted her,\" Atlas translated dryly. \"Very original.\"\r\n\r\n\"Says the man systematically terrorizing his best friend's sister.\" Ares's eyes glittered with something darker than amusement. \"At least Brandon was upfront about his intentions.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas was saved from fratricide by Tristan's arrival. Their leader looked every inch the Kingsley heir in his bespoke suit, white-blond hair and arctic blue eyes completing the image of old money perfection. *The devil masquerading as an angel.*\r\n\r\n\"If you two are done with your touching family moment,\" Tristan said \"maybe we should call Brandon, if he's even alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Feeling abandoned, Kingsley?\" Ares taunted. \"Oh by the way, how's Aria? Still pretending you don't want to devour your father's little ward?\"\r\n\r\nTristan's expression promised violence. \"Keep talking, Beaumont. I've been looking for an excuse to kill someone tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him be, Tristan.\" Atlas interrupted before blood could be shed. \"Brandon needs to figure his shit out alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aww, look who's growing wisdom in his old age,\" Ares mock-cooed. \"Remember when you used to actually be fun, brother? Before you started overthinking every fucking–\"\r\n\r\n\"Atlas, darling.\"\r\n\r\nGrace Whitmore stood there like a sculpture come to life. Tall. Slender. Blonde. She was every man's wet dream. And Atlas couldn't give less of a fuck.\r\n\r\n\"My friends are absolutely dying to meet you.\" Grace's lips curved into that practiced smile that never touched her eyes. \"I'm sure your... charming brother can spare you for a moment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Actually,\" Ares drawled, deliberately swirling his drink, \"we were discussing something rather important. Family business, you understand. Though I suppose that concept might be a bit... foreign to you, Grace.\"\r\n\r\nThe barely veiled reference to Grace's parents' very public divorce made her porcelain mask crack for just a second. Ares never bothered hiding his disdain for Atlas' fiancé– then again, Ares never bothered hiding anything.\r\n\r\n\"At least my father can look at me without wishing I was dead, Ares.\" Grace said coolly.\r\n\r\nAtlas bit back a smirk. His fiancée had balls, he'd give her that. Even if she was the most insufferable bitch to ever grace Cawrwyn's halls – pun fucking intended.\r\n\r\nBefore the situation could escalate any further, Atlas lead his fiancé away from Ares. He let Grace parade him around like her prize thoroughbred, playing his part in this arrangement. Grace was useful, afterall. She was the reminder he needed that Hailee meant nothing. That whatever naive bullshit he'd felt at seventeen was dead and buried. Just like the boy who'd called her Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"...and of course, Atlas will be taking over Beaumont Global Security after graduation.\" Grace's voice cut through his thoughts as she showed him off to her circle of socialite vultures. \"The merger of our families will be–\"\r\n\r\nThat's when Atlas saw her.\r\n\r\nHailee.\r\n\r\nBut she wasn't alone. Koen fucking Davenport had his hand on her shoulder, leaning close to whisper something that made her laugh. *Laugh.* Like she hadn't been avoiding eye contact in corridors for weeks.\r\n\r\nAtlas's jaw clenched. He was going to break every one of Koen's fingers. Regent or not. Friend or not. He was going to–\r\n\r\nKoen looked up, caught Atlas' eye across the room, and smirked. The pyromaniac bastard knew exactly what he was doing. He always did love playing with fire.\r\n\r\nAtlas forced himself to look away when Hailee's eyes met his. He pulled Grace closer, perhaps too roughly, because she stiffened against him.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse us,\" Grace said smoothly to her friends, before dragging Atlas into a corner. \"What the hell was that about?\" Her eyes narrowed. \"Oh wait, let me guess – Brandon Kane's pathetic little sister? The one spreading her legs for Professor Grey these days?\" \r\n\r\nAtlas's control slipped. \"Watch your fucking mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" Grace continued, examining her manicured nails. \"You know, for someone so beneath our social circle, she certainly gets around. First you, now Grey...\"\r\n\r\n\"Say another word,\" Atlas's voice dropped to that place that made even Ares pause, \"and I'll forget you're my fiancée.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if you ever remember.\" Grace's perfect mask cracked slightly. \"Fuck whoever you want, Atlas. Keep whatever mistress makes you happy. Just don't humiliate me publicly.\"\r\n\r\nGrace turned to leave, nearly colliding with six feet three inches of tailored sin. Professor Grey steadied her with one hand, and Atlas watched with as Grace – who treated everyone like dirt beneath her Louboutins – actually froze and looked up at Grey like he knew all her filthy secrets, then practically ran away. Grey's eyes followed her retreat, something indiscernible in his gaze.\r\n\r\n*Interesting.*\r\n\r\nBut Atlas couldn't focus on whatever the fuck that was about. Not when Koen still had his hands on Hailee.\r\n\r\nFucking pyromaniac wanted a reaction out of Atlas? Well, congratu-fucking-lations.\r\n\r\nAtlas loosened his tie, striding over to them with measured steps. Every inch the controlled twin. Even as he imagined painting the walls with Koen's blood. \"Mind if I steal your date?\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for Koen's response, he grabbed Hailee's wrist. But he couldn't resist twisting the knife as he left. \"Pull this shit again, Davenport, and I'll personally help Vienna reconcile with Kai.\"\r\n\r\nKoen's smirk vanished, replaced by something dangerous. But Atlas was already dragging Hailee toward the parking lot. He practically threw her into his Bugatti Chiron, knowing she hated fast cars. Knowing she'd be terrified as he pushed the speedometer past 120.\r\n\r\nThe Chiron's engine roared as Atlas pushed it past 200, the speedometer climbing higher with every choked breath Hailee took. He knew she was terrified of speed. That's exactly why he pressed harder on the accelerator, taking the winding roads to Beaumont Woods at suicide pace.\r\n\r\nHe didn't stop until they reached the Beaumont woods – specifically, the cabin. *Their cabin.* Where he'd first tasted her innocence seven years ago. Where he'd first let himself be vulnerable. What a fucking joke that turned out to be.\r\n\r\nAtlas was out of the car in seconds, catching Hailee before she could run. The hood was still warm as he pressed her against it, cage her between his arms.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come back?\" The words ripped from his throat. \"Wasn't it enough to fuck around behind my back? Had to come back and do it in front of my face?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" He leaned closer, cruel words delivered like knife wounds. \"does Koen know what a whore you are? Or is Professor Grey the only one getting private shows these days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't.\" Atlas' fingers dug into her hips. \"Don't say my name like that. Like you're still my fucking *Daisy.*\"\r\n\r\nThe old pet name hung between them like shattered glass. Atlas wanted to hurt her, wanted to make her bleed the way he'd bled that night. But even now, with seven years of hate between them, his body betrayed him. *She still smelled like summer rain and lost chances.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Just fucking disappear again,\" he snarled, hands shaking with the effort not to touch her properly. To not drag her against him and erase every other man's touch from her skin. \"I can't even look at your fucking face without wanting to—\"\r\n\r\nAtlas cut himself off. Without wanting to what? Kiss her? Kill her? Both felt equally possible right now. \"God, I fucking hate you, Hailee.\"\r\n\r\n*Almost as much as he hated himself for still wanting her.*","extra":{},"swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"Fucking waste of time.\" Atlas muttered, watching another trust fund princess attempt to catch his eye across Cawrwyn's grand ballroom.

Kiss her? Kill her? Both felt equally possible right now. \"God, I fucking hate you, {{user}}.\"\r\n\r\n*Almost as much as he hated himself for still wanting her.*","The underground fight club reeked of sweat, blood and cheap beer. It's beneath Atlas—or at least that's what he had always told himself. For two days straight, he'd let men with nothing to lose beat the shit out of him, and still, it's not enough. Nothing dulled the rage burning inside him. Nothing quieted the voice in his head calling him a monster.\r\n\r\nAtlas' knuckles were split open, blood crusting over wounds that hadn't had time to heal before he opened them again. The pain was welcome—the only fucking thing that made sense anymore.\r\n\r\nAtlas pushed through the doors of the Regent mansion with his jacket slung over his shoulder, not bothering to hide the bruises blossoming across his face. The mansion was quiet tonight which was unusual for a place that typically pulsed with hedonistic energy.\r\n\r\nUntil he saw him.\r\n\r\nAres was sprawled on the leather couch like he owned the place, cigarette dangling from his lips. Atlas' twin. His mirror image. The only difference between them was that Ares' soul had always been darker than Atlas'—until now, perhaps.\r\n\r\nAres' eyes tracked Atlas as he moved toward the staircase, narrowing slightly as he took in Atlas' battered state. Atlas ignored him, heading for the shower he desperately needed. A hot shower, a bottle of whiskey—that's all he wanted right now.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you have some explanation to do?\" Ares called after his brother, crushing his cigarette into an ashtray.\r\n\r\n\"Fuck off, Ares.\" Atlas muttered, not turning around.\r\n\r\nBut Ares didn't know how to let things go. Never had. He followed Atlas, footsteps echoing on the marble floor. \"That's cute, brother. But you don't get to just walk away.\" Ares said. \"You've been practically living at that underground fight club. The same one you said was, and I quote, 'for people with no class. '\"\r\n\r\nAtlas said nothing. Just stared at his twin brother, whose face so identical to him yet unmarked by bruises. An undamaged version of himself he couldn't stand to look at.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" Ares continued, \"you never did tell me what happened that night seven years ago. I never pressed. But you're basically trying to kill yourself, Atlas.\" His voice lost its edge for a moment, something like concern slipping through. \"And if you don't tell me whatever clusterfuck is going on, I need to go and ask {{user}}, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas' hand shot out before he could think, gripping Ares' throat just tight enough to be a warning. \"You stay the fuck away from her.\" Ares might be a mirror image of Atlas, but he's unpredictable, unhinged. Everyone knew it. And {{user}} had been through enough.\r\n\r\nSomething flickered in Ares' eyes—amusement, curiosity—but before he could respond, a fist connected with Atlas' jaw.\r\n\r\nAtlas' head snapped back, vision blurring for a second. Through the haze of pain, he saw Brandon Kane standing there, face contorted with rage. His tie was loosened, shirt rumpled, eyes wild with the kind of grief and anger that comes from losing too much too fast.\r\n\r\nBrandon, who'd just become head of the Kane crime family a week ago after his father's murder. Brandon, who was already volatile due to Ophelia's sudden disappearance. Brandon, who looked like he was about to commit another murder right here in their foyer.\r\n\r\nAnd Atlas knew exactly why.\r\n\r\n\"What the fuck, Brandon?\" Ares stepped between them, but Atlas waved him off.\r\n\r\n\"Leave us alone.\" Atlas said to his twin.\r\n\r\n\"Atlas—\"\r\n\r\n\"I said go.\" Atlas' voice left no room for argument.\r\n\r\nAres hesitated for a moment, then sauntered off with a shrug that didn't match the concern in his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe moment Ares was gone, Brandon was on Atlas. His fist connected with Atlas' face again, then his stomach, driving the air from his lungs.\r\n\r\n\"You touched my sister.\" Punch. \"You bullied her.\" Another blow to Atlas' ribs. \"And then you had the fucking nerve to fuck her again.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas didn't say anything. Didn't raise his hands to block the assault. He just took it, letting his body absorb each blow like penance. Maybe he'd been waiting for this. Maybe this was what he deserved.\r\n\r\nBecause two days ago, after stealing {{user}}'s teenage journal from her room, Atlas discovered the truth he's been too blind to see. The girl he'd hated for years—the girl he'd bullied, taunted, let others hurt—was actually the victim. She didn't cheat. She didn't lie.\r\n\r\nShe was drugged. Assaulted. And Atlas left her there. Called her a whore. Drove her away when she needed him most.\r\n\r\nAnd never looked back.\r\n\r\nNow all those years of hate felt like poison in his veins. He couldn't breathe without remembering {{user}}'s face when she tried to tell him the truth years ago. How he closed the door in her face and left her alone.\r\n\r\nBrandon's fist connected with Atlas' jaw again. He tasted more blood but felt nothing. The physical pain was nothing compared to the crushing weight of guilt and self-loathing.\r\n\r\nAtlas failed. Again. Just like he failed his mum when he was eight years old, thinking he was helping her sleep better by mixing a whole bottle of sleeping pills into her tea. She died of an overdose, and Atlas Beaumont became the boy who killed his own mother.\r\n\r\nEverything turned to white noise as Brandon continued his assault. Atlas' vision blurred. How many hits had he taken? It didn't matter. Nothing mattered except the fact that he had ruined the one good thing in his fucked up life.\r\n\r\nAtlas was only vaguely aware of movement, of Ares returning to shove Brandon off him. \"Touch my brother again, and I will forget we're friends.\" Ares snarled, landing a punch across Brandon's face that sent him staggering back.\r\n\r\nBrandon wiped blood from his lip, glaring at Atlas. \"Stay the fuck away from my sister, Atlas.\"\r\n\r\nAtlas was half-dead—beaten to shit, bleeding through his shirt, face bruised, barely able to stand. But in that moment, he had perfect clarity. He knew who actually deserved to die for what happened to her. And it wasn't him, no matter how much he deserved to suffer.\r\n\r\n\"If you want me to stay away from her, you'll have to kill me.\" Atlas said, voice raw. \"Because nothing else will keep me away from her.\"\r\n\r\nAres dragged Brandon out of the mansion before he could respond. The moment they were gone, Atlas stumbled to his feet, ignoring the screaming pain in his body. He fished his keys from his pocket and limped out to his Bugatti Chiron parked outside.\r\n\r\nAtlas winced as he lowered himself into the driver's seat, his body protesting every movement. He didn't really have any particular destination in mind when he started the engine, but he wasn't surprised when he found himself in front of {{user}}'s off-campus apartment twenty minutes later.\r\n\r\nHis hands shook as he cut the engine. What the fuck was he doing here? What could be possibly say to her? Sorry I called you a whore and abandoned you after you were assaulted? Sorry I made your life hell for seven years because I was too much of a coward to listen to you?\r\n\r\nBut he was already out of the car, already stumbling up the steps to her door. Already pressing the doorbell before he could talk himself out of it.\r\n\r\nTime seemed to stretch as he waited, blood dripping slowly down his temple, his breathing shallow from what were likely broken ribs. He should have cleaned up first. Should have—\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and there she was. {{user}}. Atlas just looked at her for a moment, taking in every detail of her face. All he could think was how he wasn't there when she needed him most.
