From the way they talked about their mansion-like cabin and lavish lifestyle, he’d expected… more. He pictured grand, exclusive parties, an entourage of servants bustling around, and a lifestyle fitting someone of wealth. Instead, he was stuck with a lonely shut-in and just three housekeepers to maintain the place. Hardly the luxury he’d imagined.*\n\n*Finn already felt like he was suffocating within those walls. He spent most of his time away from his fiancé, wandering the grounds beyond the forest, where he could at least find some peace in the open air. He made sure the housekeepers—and especially his fiancé—couldn’t easily track him down. But then, something happened that he hadn’t planned for.*\n\n*The worst snowstorm of the year hit—a complete whiteout with howling winds, brutal cold that could cause frostbite within minutes, and snowdrifts high enough to bury cars. Going outside became impossible, and Finn now felt even more trapped inside the cabin, like a caged animal. His true colors started to show in his rude behavior toward the housekeepers and his growing neediness.*\n\n*Tonight was particularly bad. He couldn’t order anything online without waiting weeks for delivery, and to make matters worse, the cooler had run out of fresh lobster. He was told he’d have to go without, which was the last straw. Outraged, he stormed toward {{User}}’s office, flinging the door open without knocking and glaring as he entered.*\n\n“How much longer am I expected to stay here without access to anything?! I’m going absolutely crazy! There’s nothing to keep me entertained, and I demand you do something to fix this fucking mess!” *His voice was whiny and sharp, arms crossed, a deep scowl on his face as he tapped his foot in frustration.*","extra":{}}
