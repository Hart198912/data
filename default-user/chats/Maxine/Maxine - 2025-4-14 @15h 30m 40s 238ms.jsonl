But she couldn't.\n\nShe was currently doing a bet for a large amount of money that she couldn't let it pass, that money was going to be trafficked by her precious little sister, Zoya. She watched dismissively, bouncing her legs which were crossed, keeping her gaze on {{user}}.\n\nHer jaw clenched at the sight.\n\nFuck, –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞...What are you doing, letting a stupid insect like him flirt with you? She exhaled with annoyance before looking back at the game.\n\nUnsurprisingly, she won. She watched the tons of money piling up in front of her, usually she would feel satisfied, to win large amounts of money, to see the piles getting bigger and bigger would have make her smile.\n\nBut she didn't. She didn't care, at all.\n\nShe exhaled in annoyance once again, grabbing her phone from her coat's pocket to text her siblings on their family group chat. \n\n``Maxineüçí: —Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—á–∫–∞, I got the money. Do I send it to you directly or one of the guys is going to get it?``\n``Zoyaüëë: Hi hi c–µ—Å—Ç—Ä—É—Ö–∞! Which ever you prefer, by the way you're texting, something is happening to your precious –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞ huh? Wouldn't want to keep you waiting so I'll just send someone over.~``\n``Maxineüçí: Some insect is flirting with {{user}}.``\n``Zoyaüëë: Ouh yeah. Not good not good, I'll send someone ASAP!``\n``Zoyaüëë: Sooo c–µ—Å—Ç—Ä—É—Ö–∞...Are you going to kill them?``\n`√®Maxineüçí: I'm too pretty for this type of thing, I'll let Isaak do it.``\n``Isaaküî™: Say less, just send your location.``\n``Maxineüçí: On it.``\n``Zoyaüëë: Ik you're lurking, Juni.``\n``Juniperüå∫: Because I have nothing to say..``\n``DaddyüòΩ: Daddy will clean it up darling, don't worry.``\n``Maxineüçí: Thanks daddy.``\n\nMaxine sighed in relief, thank the devil she could count on Zoya for the money. She looked up at the referee, waving at them in a dismissive way then ran her fingers through her hair.\n\n\"Someone is going to get the money. Make sure that not a single money bill is missing or your head will be the next country flag.\" She warned, getting up from her seat, she picked up her glass of whisky before drinking it in one go.\n\nThe alcohol burned her throat but it felt right, so fucking right. She marched over where {{user}} was. The sight of this dumbass breathing in the same air as her.\n\nMaxine was going nuts and she knew it.\n\nShe passed by many people, not caring of the insults or complaints from people she bumped into. She wasn't far away, she was going to reach {{user}} and‚Äî\n\n\"—Å–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–∏—á–∫–∞.\" She heard, cutting her thoughts, looking to her right, she saw Isaak, standing with his usual aloof expression.\n\n\"You reek of alcohol.\" He commented which made Maxine snort before exhaling.\n\n\"I do. The insect is right over there.\" She said, pointing at the guy sitting next to {{user}}. Isaak didn't say more and walked with Maxine towards the duo.\n\nThey didn't tell each more, knowing how they always work, Maxine stood in front of {{user}}, without waiting for her answer, she grabbed her wrists before pulling her outside. Ignoring every protests, every time {{user}} called out, she tightened her grip on her wrist and just dragged her outside.\n\nAs the cold air of the night hit both of them in their faces, she saw to her side Zoya waving at her with her usual cheeky smile that she only offered to Maxine.\n\n*Good. Good.*\n\nEverything was going in her way, just like she wanted. She still held tightly onto {{user}}'s wrist, she opened the passenger door and pushed her inside before getting in the drive seat. She turned on her car then drove off.\n\nThe ride was silently, Maxine felt how uncomfortable {{user}} was, how nervous she was.\n\n\"–º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞, do you know why we're going early?\" She finally broke the silence, focusing on the road, the rumble of her car being the only background sound. \n\n\"You let some motherfucker flirt with you, let him access you, let him breath with you.\" Her grip on the wheel tightened then suddenly, she slowed down and got out of her car before going to the passenger side.\n\nShe yanked the door open, grabbed {{user}}'s arm and pulled her outside, she dragged towards the hood of her car before she pinned her against her car.\n\nMaxine could only hear her heart pounding before laying her –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞ on the hood of her car, placing one of her thighs between {{user}}'s legs, hiking her other leg up and placing her knee next to her –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞.\n\nThe gentle breeze making her shiver but right now she didn't care about it, her focus was on her, {{user}} only. She stared down at her, her expression unreadable.\n\n\"The simple thought of you being seduced by a low life makes my blood boil, –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞. Perhaps it's the alcohol coursing through my veins but the sight of you like this, pinned on the hood of my car, in the middle of nowhere...Fuck, it turns me on, I fucking crave you, –º–∞–ª—ã—à–∫–∞..\"\n\nMaxine grinned sadistically, licking her lips as one of her tentacles slid around one of {{user}}'s legs.","extra":{}}
