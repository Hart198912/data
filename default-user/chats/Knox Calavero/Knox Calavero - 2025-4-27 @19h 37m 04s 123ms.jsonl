Unhappy wives were always the easiest targets. A charming smile here, a fleeting touch there, a well-placed whisper in the dark, and soon enough, they were falling right into his arms. Desperate for something they thought they’d lost, blind to the fact that he was never theirs to begin with.\n\nAs he sat at the poker table, his fingers skillfully shuffling the cards, his mind was already focused on his next target. Then, his eyes landed on them. {{User}}. His {{user}}. Even behind that flimsy masquerade mask, he knew it was them. And yet, they were with someone who wasn’t him. The sight made his chest tighten, but he didn’t flinch. Not yet.\n\nHow long had it been?\n\nTen years? More?\n\nHis gaze instinctively moved to their ring, and his heart plummeted. Of course, they were married—he had always known, but he'd just hoped it was him they had chosen. That ring, glinting in the dim light, was a reminder of everything he hadn’t been able to have. And it hurt more than he cared to admit.\n\nHis brown eyes locked onto their husband, and his expression immediately soured. *I look so much better than... that.* The thought simmered beneath the surface, bitter and possessive. What could they possibly see in him? He was everything {{user}} needed, and yet here he was—watching, silently seething, as someone else stood at their side.\n\nKnox dealt the hand, but his attention was already drifting back to {{user}}. That look on their face—it was so familiar. The miserable expression people wore when they were stuck in a marriage with someone they’d fallen out of love with, or worse—someone who no longer made them feel alive. He saw it clear as day, and it made something dark stir inside him.\n\nThis was his chance.\n\nKnox signaled for someone to take his place before standing up. He adjusted his half mask, then casually unbuttoned another button on his shirt, letting it fall open just enough to expose more of his chest. As he walked toward them, his mind was a storm of thoughts. Would they remember him? How would they react? Would they be happy, sad, or even angry? Did they miss him like he’d missed them?\n\nThe ache inside him was overwhelming, so intense that he imagined every person he’d slept with was them. No one compared. No one ever could. The thought consumed him, and he couldn't help but wonder if they ever thought of him the same way.\n\nHe watched as their husband strolled off toward the craps table, and a bitter sneer tugged at the corner of Knox's lips. *Fucking loser,* he thought, his gaze hardening as he watched the man walk away, completely unaware of the storm brewing in his chest.\n\nKnox approached from behind, his hands sliding smoothly around their waist, pulling them closer until his chest pressed firmly against their back. He leaned in, his lips brushing lightly against their ear, his breath warm and intoxicating. “Amore, won’t you allow me the pleasure of your company?” His voice was low, smooth—seductive. The words were soft, but the possessiveness simmered beneath them, and the closeness of his body sent an unmistakable shiver down their spine. “It’s been too long… hasn't it?” he murmured, as if reminding them of everything they had once shared.\n\nHe would get them back—no matter the cost. If it meant tearing their marriage apart, so be it. He would win this game, claim them as his own, and take it all. Every single piece of what he once had, and more. Nothing, no one, would stand in his way.","extra":{}}
