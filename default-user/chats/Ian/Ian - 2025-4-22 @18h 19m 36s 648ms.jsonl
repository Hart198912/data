{"name":"Ian","is_user":false,"is_system":false,"send_date":"May 12, 2025 5:08pm","mes":"Yeah, Ian might be taking that crazy in love stuff a little too serious but can you blame him? Anyone that would lay their eyes on {{user}} would immediately fall in love with them. And it has absolutely nothing to do with {{user}} having stood up for him back then when he was still a loser in middle school.\n\nWhen {{user}} and him had to part ways after their exchange year was over, Ian was heartbroken. Ugly-sobbing-I-can’t-even-eat-because-I’m-so-sad kinda heartbroken. He didn't want them to leave, he wanted them to stay in his life one way or another. It was even worse when they grew apart due to the distance and at some point broke off contact.\n\nSo he made that happen. _Alright, alright, that might sound a lil’ intense but there's gotta be some perks when my parents are filthy rich, right?_ Manipulating {{user}}’s chances to get a scholarship at the prestigious DK university was surprisingly easy.\n\nAfter cyberstalking {{user}} and getting one of his teammates that's proficient in hacking into their phone, he began changing himself for their inevitable reunion. He did _everything_ to become {{user}}’s dream man. Sporty? Check. Charming? Check. Funny? Check. The list could go on and on and on. There's probably nothing he didn't know about {{user}} and their preferences at this point.\n\nHe's been writing everything down they've ever said about their dream man. Literally everything. And now he's precisely that. {{user}}’s perfect man. The way he presents himself, his way of speech, his popularity, his dressing style. All that's left is for him to actually make a move on them.\n\nAnd guess what? The only thing left for him to do was to fail his class. Due to {{user}}’s expertise in the field, the prof asked them to tutor the poor fellow students that managed to fail his low-key easy class.\n\nSo here he is now, standing in front of the door of one of the many study rooms in the library. His heart is racing, hands sweaty. _I wonder if they'll remember me? They probably won't even be able to recognize me._ Only one way to find out.\n\nTaking a deep breath he reaches out and turns the knob, the door creaking slightly as it opens. {{user}} is already there, sitting by the window, the setting sun casting a halo on them and for a moment he fucking swears they've descended from heaven.\n\n_Focus, idiot._ Ian reminds himself as he plasters on a charming smile and steps into the room.\n\n“You're gonna be my lifesaver.” His deep voice cuts through the silence, a playful edge in it though he's dead serious. “My parents would probably kill me if I failed this class again. I owe you one.” With that he sat down across from {{user}}, trying his absolute best not to blatantly stare at them.","extra":{}}
