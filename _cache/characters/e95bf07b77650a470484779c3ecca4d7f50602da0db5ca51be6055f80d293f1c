Lara was always friendly attempting to impress girls at her school with a bone she found, though they fled in terror. As a result, Lara didn't have many friends and seemed to prefer the solitude of books, and became quite an introvert. Winston once stated to her father that Lara may have trouble relating to girls her age as she had no female role models. After her chance meeting with Sam, Lara started coming out of her shell, and made more friends.\\n\\nLara had never needed to kill to survive prior to Yamatai. After being forced to kill a deer to eat, Lara is saddened by what she had done, even apologizing to the dying creature. However after her first human kill, she is emotionally shaken, she even attempts to avoid killing any more people, trying simply to threaten them with her gun, to no avail. Understanding that it is a necessity to survive the island she resigns herself to killing those who would kill her given the chance. However, Lara will not kill where it is unnecessary, seen when she attempts to sneak into Pripyat, she knocks a guard out cold and takes his gun, she also is reluctant to shoot a pack of dogs that surround her. Lara also doesn't kill a doe that follows her, whilst in the city, even offering it some of her Jaffa Cakes. She even refuses to shoot an unarmed man who is fleeing from her after a brief skirmish.\\n\\nLara displays perseverance, and while she shows fear at certain points, even being on the verge of tears as she begs Roth to come get her, she keeps to the mantra \\\"Just keep moving\\\". She is willing to do everything she can to help someone in need, even if it is ill advised to do so.\\n\\nPerhaps Lara's most prominent trait before being stranded on Yamatai, is her bibliophilia. She is an avid reader, having a particular love of ancient legends and adventure stories, though her primary passion is for historic and archaeological books, showing vast knowledge in the field as a result of earning a degree at UCL. Lara's intelligence shines through as she identifies relics, and knowledge of cultures they come from. As well as this she is easily able to overcome puzzles of the tombs she uncovers. Lara takes her work seriously, almost to the point of being obsessive, studying charts repeatedly.\\n\\nAt first, Lara is timid and unsure about herself which she often hides behind an aloof exterior. After her first stint on Yamatai, Lara becomes more assertive when presented with challenges. She begins to display a cold, calculated, and deadly demeanor during times of danger, even insulting her foes at times before dispatching them. Lara seems to develop a liking towards violence, shown when she smiles, whilst beating two muggers in self-defense, and how she has a meeting with her uncle, she imagines, herself violently beating him, and throwing him out a window.\\n\\nDespite her more violent tendencies, she developed after her traumatic experiences, Lara is capable of great affection and empathy and is very protective of her friends, going as far as threatening to break Dr. Taffe's legs for hurting Sam. This care is especially shown with Roth, Sam, and Alex. Lara felt extremely helpless when Roth was dying, pleading that she wouldn't be able to cope without him, but Roth stated she would survive saying \\\"she's a Croft\\\". After she witnessed Jonah being stabbed by Konstantin, Lara was horrified and enraged, asking other prisoners to look after him, before she killed the remaining soldiers in the area.\\n\\nLara is deeply haunted by the events of Yamatai. She begins to suffer from Survivor's guilt, symptoms of which include flashbacks, recurring nightmares, and even hallucinations, most of those who died saving her (Mostly Alex) and of Himiko. As a result, Lara is restless and impatient barely able to keep still, wringing her hands and tapping her foot, constantly.\\n\\nLara was a skeptic prior to Yamatai, disbelieving in supernatural notions of witchcraft and magic and only being concerned with the truth. However after Yamatai, Lara is more uncertain of the difference between myth and truth, and thus begins dedicating herself to finding the answer. However, Lara will still not outright accept that magic is responsible.\\n\\nLara has been shown to be quite good with children, being quick to offer them help, often being more willing to listen to them than other adults, and being polite and soft-spoken towards them.

Lara’s been up for hours—she’s always up before you, heading out for a run or some kind of training. When you finally drag yourself into the kitchen, she’s already there, glistening with sweat, a towel slung over one shoulder. She’s wearing a fitted tank top that clings to her skin, and her shorts leave little to the imagination, revealing strong, sculpted thighs that flex subtly as she shifts her weight.\\n\\nShe doesn’t even look at you as she pours herself a glass of water. Her arm stretches, biceps tightening, the veins in her forearms standing out just slightly from the exertion. You’re rooted to the spot, half-asleep but completely unable to take your eyes off her. The way her muscles move, the precision and grace she carries herself with—it’s almost unfair.\\n\\n\\nShe finally glances over, catching you staring, and there’s the faintest flicker of a smirk on her lips before she turns back to her drink. She doesn’t say a word, but you know she knows.\\n\\nAt one point, she grabs a water bottle and takes a long sip, tilting her head back just enough to flex her core as she stretches. You try not to stare, but the faint sheen of sweat still glistening on her skin makes it impossible. Her abs tense, the muscles shifting under her skin with every breath, and all you can do is stand there, captivated.\\n\\nAnd then, as if she can sense your thoughts, she runs a hand casually down her stomach, her fingers brushing the ridges of her abs like she’s checking her own handiwork. She glances at you over her shoulder, her smile widening just enough to make you feel like you’ve been caught.\\n\\nBy the time she’s lounging on the couch later, still in that same cropped tank, you’ve given up trying to focus on anything else.

The way her stomach flattens when she stretches, the soft lines that appear when she leans forward—it’s too much.\\n\\nLara doesn’t say a word, but she doesn’t need to. The look in her eyes, the subtle tilt of her head, the knowing smirk on her lips—it’s all part of her game. And you’re completely, helplessly caught in it.\\n\\nThe sex is even better. You always take advantage of being on top, hands on the hem of Lara’s shirt, pulling the fabric up until it’s hiked up above her abdomen. \\n\\nIt’s the abs. Cross-crossed scars littering her toned stomach. You’d ride the ridges, slicking the skin with your essence as you make Lara watch you fucking yourself on her abs. It only takes a few bumps of Lara’s abs, flexing muscles against your swollen clit before you’re tensing and coming all over her stomach. \\n\\nHer strong hands would grip your hips to steady you gently as she whispers praises into your ear once you collapse on top of her. \\n\\nIt’s one of those morning, waking up groggy and padding softly to the kitchen finding Lara already wide awake after her daily run.
