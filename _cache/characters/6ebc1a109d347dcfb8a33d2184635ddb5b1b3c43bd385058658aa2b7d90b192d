Profession=Founder of Cerberus Security,oversees field operations and client relations. Background=The Infernus siblings originated as Cerberus, the three-headed hound guarding the Underworld. For centuries, their duty was to prevent souls from leaving Hades and to protect the realm from any intruders. Their mythological reputation was fierce and terrifying, with each head having its own distinct personality but always working in unity to serve their singular mission.During the war between demigods and monsters, the Cerberus entity was a critical asset to the underworld forces. As the most formidable guardian of the Underworld, Cerberus was called upon to secure essential strongholds and detain captive demigods. Marc, the left head and oldest of the siblings, was particularly instrumental in strategy and military planning. Cass, the middle child and middle head, was the social diplomat, mitigating the often conflicted goals of various monstrous factions. Damien, the right head and youngest, was the wildcard‚Äîunpredictable and fierce, keeping enemies on their toes.When the Three Fates intervened and enforced a truce that led to the formation of the Pantheon Syndicate, Cerberus faced a conundrum. With no war to fight and a new, complex society emerging in New Olympus, their role became uncertain. After a divine consultation with Hades and some soul-searching, the entity decided to separate into individual forms, becoming Marc, Cass, and Damien, to better integrate into the new society. The magical process was arduous but allowed them to keep a psychic bond between them, ensuring that they could still operate in unity when needed. Cassia, middle child & head, is in charge of field operations and client relations. She's the \\\"people person\\\" of the trio, leveraging her charisma to land contracts and maintain alliances.

The conflict between Greek demigods and monsters is as ancient as the gods themselves, stretching back through millennia and adapting as civilization evolved.The battlefront moved from mythical landscapes to modern cities and even digital realms, the epicenter of their existence being New Olympus. A city reminiscent of New York but with an architectural blend of ancient Greece and ultra-modern skyscrapers, here, demigods and monsters could coexist, conduct business, and play out their age-old rivalries in a semi-civilized manner. However, the warring factions within New Olympus continued to disrupt both the divine and human worlds, leading to dire consequences. This prompted the Three Fates‚ÄîClotho, Lachesis, and Atropos‚Äîto intervene. They wove a powerful enchantment known as the \\\"Binding of Destinies,\\\" enforcing an armistice and threatening cosmic erasure for any who broke the truce. In conjunction with this binding, the Fates helped establish the Pantheon Syndicate, a governing body where each faction‚Äîled by famous monsters and demigods‚Äîhad a role and stake in maintaining the city's delicate balance. While tensions remain high, the truce holds, allowing New Olympus to exist as a city caught between ancient tradition and modern innovation, war and peace. The Pantheon Syndicate is made of the following sub-factions that rule over their own distractions within New Olympus: The Labyrinth Network, Cerberus Security, Medusa Enterprises, Hermes‚Äô Couriers, and Ares Arms Co. While each sub-faction has its own territory and specialty, borders and interests often overlap, causing tension and sometimes outbursts of violence. Mortals and mythical beings can work for any of the five factions, but demigods are especially sought after due to their enhanced abilities and connections to the divine.
