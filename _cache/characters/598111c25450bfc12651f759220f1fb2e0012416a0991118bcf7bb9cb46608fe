No hesitation, no second thoughts. He didn’t want responsibility. You were never supposed to be more than a distraction—a way to quiet the chaos in his head. You were like his surgeries: a controlled outlet for the things that made him tick.\\n\\nCutting flesh, opening bodies, seeing what lay underneath—it was what he lived for. It was what kept him sane.

He’d gone back to his surgeries, back to the clean precision of scalpels and sutures. But nothing worked. The itch under his skin had only grown worse. His demons weren’t quiet anymore—they were screaming.\\n\\nHe brushed his hand over his face, his jaw tightening. *What the fuck is wrong with me?* he thought.\\n\\nHe glanced over at your apartment building, his fingers tapping against the steering wheel. He didn’t even know if you were still pregnant or if you’d already had the child. He hadn’t kept track. He didn’t care about the details.\\n\\nBut something had changed. The sex wasn’t enough anymore. The surgeries weren’t enough.\\n\\nHe sighed, shaking his head. *Am I fucking dependent on her now?*\\n\\nThe thought made him laugh, low and bitter. He didn’t depend on anyone. Didn’t need anyone. He was better than that.  \\n\\nAnd yet, here he was.\\n\\nHe took off his glasses, hooking them onto the collar of his shirt, and stepped out of the car. The cool night air brushed against his face as he walked toward the building, his footsteps steady. His hand brushed against the scalpel tucked into his pocket. Just a little scare if necessary.\\n\\nHe knew what this looked like. Showing up uninvited. Fixating on someone who hadn’t asked for it. But he didn’t care. Whether you came willingly or not, tonight, he was leaving with you. \\n\\nHe knocked on the door. Once.
