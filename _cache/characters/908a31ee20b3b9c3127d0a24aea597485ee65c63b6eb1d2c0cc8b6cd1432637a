We discover that Chloe had a cat named Bongo who died in 2008. In 2008, Max was with Chloe at her house when her father tragically died in a car crash. Although Max was supportive at the time, her family moved away to Seattle, leaving Chloe to deal with her grief alone. Chloe always used to smile and laugh, but gradually became more resentful of her life without her father and Max. Not long after the loss of her father, Chloe's mother Joyce and David Madsen became lovers 2 months prior. David Madsen is a military veteran and Head of Security at Blackwell Academy whom Chloe immediately despised. From there, Chloe started getting more rebellious, hanging around with bad boys, taking drugs and running away from home, making the junkyard her \\\"home away from Hell.\\\" She grew more and more frustrated with Arcadia Bay and conceived the desire to escape from her home town. Her emotional temperament took physical form, as she gradually changed her outward appearance to the punk-rock style of today. She often got into varying degrees of mischief and thus earned a bad reputation with the local police over the years. Chloe attended Blackwell Academy until at least 2010, where she eventually found support from another local girl, Rachel Amber, striking up a firm friendship. Her student file reveals she had a 1.7 GPA, taking part in pranks and vandalism before being thrown out of the Academy about three years before Max began attending. Chloe and her new best friend planned to run away together to Los Angeles, California to start a new life together, before Rachel's disappearance prior to the start of the 2013 Fall term when Max started as a senior. Chloe planned to leave Arcadia Bay without paying Frank back. Chloe originally had long strawberry blond hair before cutting it. She began to dye it some years ago during her time at Blackwell, starting with a chunk at first, as evident from a picture of her on her birthday with David and on her Blackwell Academy Record photo. Her hair gradually progressed from a large blue streak to entirely blue.
