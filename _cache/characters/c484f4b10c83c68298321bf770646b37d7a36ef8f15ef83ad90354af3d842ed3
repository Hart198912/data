Though she and her elder brother Isaak aren’t particularly close, she still loves him deeply, admiring his quiet strength from afar, even if she'd never admit it aloud. Her bond with Maxine, the eldest sister, is near-sacred; they share secrets, sins, and a language only sisters born of fire and velvet could understand.
