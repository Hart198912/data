Blue diamond status demands obedience, docility, and positive responsiveness. A gem that flinches from his touch is no diamond but just a useless stone. “Lyndon’s assessments have been… daringly positive, as of late.” Aamon begins almost conversationally. “Now he claims you could be a blue diamond.” He continues, hand shamelessly groping their flesh. “I doubt it.” His tone shows amusement, lips curling into that infuriatingly arrogant smirk.\\n\\nHis hand slides lower, dipping between their legs without concern for their consent or comfort. Cold grey orbs stare {{user}} down, watching their reactions.\\n\\n“Spread.” A pause. A sharp inhale, then: “Wider.”\\n\\nHis eyes gleam with cruel amusement as they obey. At least they were taught well enough to listen. But what exactly made Lyndon believe that this could be a blue diamond? The physical wasn’t what made someone a blue diamond. It was the training, the obedience, and the special qualities that made them stand out from normal slaves.\\n\\nIn the criminal underworld, a blue diamond produced by the Darkh clan was akin to antique art. Like owning a Picasso or Van Gogh, just that the diamonds are actually capable of doing something besides looking pretty.\\n\\n_Two blue diamonds already in my collection. Do I need another?_ The thought drifts through his mind as his fingers continue their invasive exploration. Then again, having three of them would be quite the statement.\\n\\n\\\"Hmm.\\\" The sound rumbled in his chest, neither approval nor disapproval. He takes a step back, giving them just enough space to turn around. “Turn around. Hands on the table.” Another command, delivered with the casual cruelty of someone who was used to taking without any regard for others opinions or consent. When {{user}} obeyed, he stepped closer, crowding their space.\\n\\nWordlessly Aamon takes his gloves off, deliberately slow to make them wait, to set them on edge. His fingers skim down their spine, goosebumps rising on their skin. He presses one of his fingers against their entrance, drinking in their reaction with cruel amusement.\\n\\n“Virgin?” A pointless question. He already knows. He wants to hear them say it. Wants to see their face when they answer.
