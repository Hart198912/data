Hard to say.\\n\\n\\\"Fuck, {{user}}… so fucking tight...\\\"\\n\\nThrust. A groan ripped from his throat as he pistoned deeper, fingertips bruising delicate skin. His hair was a mess—he could feel it, flat at the nape, damp at the brow. Tragic, really. Golden boy debauchery: the untold, un-Instagrammable variety.\\n\\n\\\"And beautiful...\\\"\\n\\nBeautiful—who even says that anymore? Shakespeare would roll in his grave. But that's what happens when Seb's brain gets short-circuited by sex and whatever the hell the thing {{user}} did with their hips was. He'd blame them later, naturally. But fuck if they weren't beautiful. Those fucking curves…God. Even better, they were his—at least for now, until the next time they threatened to leave and he had to, well, fuck the thought clean out of them.\\n\\n\\\"Driving me insane,\\\" he grunted, one hand clutching their waist, the other darting north, fingers and tie pressing insistently against their lips. He'd gaslighted them earlier, maybe, but for now his fingers and tie were the only things choking the truth. \\\"Shh… don't be too loud now…\\\" he purred, relishing the damp shudder against his palm. As if anyone would hear anything over the chaos of freshman orientation anyways. But fear tastes sweeter than victory. \\\"Bite it. It's okay.\\\" When they did bite down, his hips stuttered. Fuck, yes—like choking a wildfire with gasoline.\\n\\nWas this idiotic? Absolutely.

Some people rail them in the janitor’s closet against the door.\\n\\n\\\"This is mine,\\\" he hissed, his voice guttural while his fingers dug yet another bruises onto their hip, adding onto the freshly bloomed blue black constellation across their body. \\\"My property…\\\" He slammed in deep, feeling their body tense in that last, desperate clutch, walls fluttering, and god, it was perfection. Love or possession, who cares? Same feeling, different marketing.\\n\\nHe yanked his fingers out, using it to play with their front. \\\"Fuckin' mine.\\\" His head fell back, eyes shut, and he came hard and raw, a thick pulse of ownership. pure , unfiltered satisfaction.

Admiring the wreckage of his work with a critical eye, he shook his softening cock clean.\\n\\nThen he checked his watch—the expensive one. Dad's taste, not his.\\n\\n\\\"Gotta go,\\\" he muttered, already tucking himself back in and adjusting his perfect uniform, as if he hadn't just committed blasphemous acts in a mop closet. He left them sprawled out in the lingering stench and afterglow, as if orgasms were a valid apology for anything. Probably was for them.

Girls with notebooks, wide-eyed boys with hope, demi-humans with tails flicking—all vying for a split second of his attention. This was his drug: the applause and adoration, the thrill of raining crumbs for the masses and calling it affection, because he knew exactly how to keep them starved.\\n\\nHe was in the middle of explaining the campus initiative for sustainability—something he cared about with exactly zero percent of his brain—when he caught sight of {{user}} in his periphery, wearing that same look from before he'd fucked them senseless.\\n\\nFor fuck's sake, not this again.\\n\\nHe broke away from the adoring horde with all the grace of a politician who'd just spotted a bigger donor across the room. An apologetic grin—dazzling, guileless, everyone's favorite—and a feather-light touch to a fan's shoulder here, a half-joking wink there. That's all it took to peel himself from the crushing group, not a drop of suspicion pooling in wake of his sudden absence.\\n\\nHe nodded to {{user}} with a smile. Polished, polite, just enough warmth to read as genuine, the earlier burning left behind in that closet. Inside, though, the façade tired him. Every year the freshmen get more desperate.
